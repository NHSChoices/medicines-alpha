          <h3>How does gliclazide work?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-1" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Gliclazide is a type of medicine known as a sulfonylurea. Sulfonylureas increase the amount of insulin that’s produced by your pancreas. Insulin is the hormone that controls the level of sugar in your blood.</p>

          <h3>When will I feel better?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-2" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>You may not have had any symptoms of diabetes so you won’t necessarily feel any different when you take gliclazide. This doesn’t mean that gliclazide isn’t working and it is important to keep taking it.</p>
          <p>Gliclazide will help keep your blood sugar level stable and reduce your chances of diabetes complications in the future.</p>

        </summary>
        <div id="questions-3" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Treatment for diabetes is usually for life. Do not stop taking your gliclazide tablets without talking to your doctor.</p>

          <h3>Can I take gliclazide for a long time?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-4" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Gliclazide is safe to take for a long time. There’s no evidence it harms your pancreas or your general health.</p>
          <p>However, gliclazide may stop working properly after a while. Your doctor may then want to stop it or add a different medicine to help keep your blood sugar level stable.</p>

          <p>Don't stop taking gliclazide without talking to your doctor.</p>

          <h3>Can I get diabetes medicines for free?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-6" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>If you have diabetes, you’re entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your diabetes ones).</p>
          <p>To claim your free prescriptions you’ll need to have a medical exemption certificate.</p>
          <p>The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.</p>

          <h3>Are other diabetes medicines better?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-7" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>There are other groups of medicines that can lower blood sugar levels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>metformin</li>
            <li>pioglitazone</li>
            <li>DPP-4 inhibitors such as saxagliptin</li>
            <li>SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin</li>
            <li>GLP-1 agonists such as exenatide</li>
            <li>insulin</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Gliclazide is usually prescribed if you can't take metformin, or if metformin is no longer keeping your blood sugar level under control when used by itself.</p>
          <p>Gliclazide is a sulfonylurea. There are 4 other sulfonylureas available:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>glibenclamide</li>
            <li>glimepiride</li>
            <li>glipizide</li>
            <li>tolbutamide</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These all work in the same way – by increasing the amount of insulin your body produces.</p>
          <p>Gliclazide can be prescribed on its own or in combination with the above medicines.</p>

          <h3>Can I take painkillers with gliclazide?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-8" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>It’s safe to take paracetamol with gliclazide.</p>
          <p>Do not take aspirin or ibuprofen. These painkillers can interfere with gliclazide and lower your blood sugar levels too much.</p>

          <p>If your blood sugar levels are well controlled, your ability to drive, cycle or use machines or tools should not be affected. However, if your blood sugar levels become too low, this can affect your concentration.</p>

        </summary>
        <div id="questions-11" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>For women, gliclazide will not affect contraceptive pills or the morning after pill.</p>
          <p>However, some women might need a small adjustment in their gliclazide dose after starting contraceptive pills as in rare cases they can increase blood sugar levels.</p>

          <h3>Can I take gliclazide before surgery?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-12" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>If you are going to have an operation, tell your doctor you are taking gliclazide.</p>
          <p>If you take gliclazide there is a potential risk of low blood sugar during the operation. Low blood sugar can be difficult to detect when a general anaesthetics (that puts you to sleep) is used.</p>
          <p>For a few days around the time of your operation, your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin instead.</p>

          <h3>Can lifestyle changes help my diabetes?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-13" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of diabetes.</p>
          <p>These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>eating a healthy diet</li>
            <li>losing any excess weight</li>
            <li>not smoking</li>
            <li>not drinking too much alcohol – no more than 2 glasses a day</li>
            <li>exercising regularly – up to 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is ideal</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Can I drink alcohol?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-14" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking gliclazide but it's best for women not to have more than 2 units a day and men not more than 3 units. Drinking more than this can increase the risk of low blood sugar level.</p>
          <p>Usually, a standard glass of wine or a can of beer is 2 units.</p>
          <p>Drinking cocktails with fruit juice in will also make it difficult to control your blood sugar.</p>
          <p>It's not a good idea to drink on an empty stomach.</p>

      <details role="group">

          <h3>Is there any food or drink to avoid?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-15" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>sweets</li>
            <li>cakes</li>
            <li>biscuits</li>
            <li>chocolate</li>
            <li>some fizzy drinks</li>
            <li>juice drinks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Karela (also called bitter gourd) is used to flavour foods such as curries such as bitter gourd masala. It has a bitter taste and is also made into juice and tea.</p>
          <p>Be careful eating food and drink containing karela because it can lower your blood sugar levels and mean your diabetes isn't controlled as well as it should be.</p>
