  <h3>What to do about:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong> feeling sick </strong>- take your tablets before a meal. Stick to simple meals and avoid rich or spicy food</li>
  <li><strong>diarrhoea and vomiting </strong>- drink plenty of water if you have diarrhoea or you are being sick â€“ have small, frequent sips. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions. You can buy these from a pharmacy or supermarket to prevent dehydration. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea or vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor</li>
  <li><strong>constipation </strong>- if you have constipation, eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Also exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to your pharmacist or doctor</li>
  <li><strong>weight gain</strong> - gliclazide can make you hungrier and retain water so it can be quite challenging to not put on weight while you're taking it. Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes so you don't gain too much weight. Regular exercise will also help to keep your weight stable</li>
  </ul>
