  <h3>What to do about:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>breathing problems</strong> – speak to you doctor as starting with a lower dose and increasing it gradually can help prevent breathing problems</li>
    <li><strong>constipation</strong> - eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and try to drink several glasses of water or other non-alcoholic liquid each day. It may also help to exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk. Speak to your doctor about medicine to help prevent or treat constipation caused by morphine if your symptoms do not go away.</li>
    <li><strong>feeling sleepy, tired or dizzy</strong> – these side effects should wear off within a week or two as your body gets used to morphine. Talk to you doctor if they carry on for longer</li>
    <li><strong>feeling sick or vomiting</strong> - take morphine with or after a meal or snack to ease feelings of sickness. This side effect should normally wear off after a few days. Talk to your doctor about taking anti-sickness medicine if it carries on for longer</li>
    <li><strong>dry mouth</strong> - try chewing sugar-free gum or sucking sugar-free sweets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don’t take any other medicines to treat the side effects of morphine without speaking to your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
