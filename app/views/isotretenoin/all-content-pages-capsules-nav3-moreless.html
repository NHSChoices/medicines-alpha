      <p>Isotretinoin capsules are a very effective treatment for severe <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Acne/Pages/Introduction.aspx">acne</a> (spots).</p>
      <p>This medicine can have serious side effects so it must be prescribed and supervised by a skin specialist.</p>
      <p>Isotretinoin also comes as a gel for milder acne.</p>
      <p>Isotretinoin capsules are also called by the brand names Roaccutane or Rizuderm.</p>
      <p>Treatment with isotretinoin capsules is not suitable for children under 12 or who have not started puberty.</p>

        <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Isotretinoin capsules are usually taken once or twice a day straight after a meal or snack.</li>
          <li>Acne normally improves after taking isotretinoin capsules for a week to 10 days.</li>
          <li>Most people have clear skin after a four to five month course of isotretinoin capsules.</li>
          <li>The most common side effects of isotretinoin capsules are headaches, aching muscles and joints, dry sensitive skin and skin being sensitive to sunlight.</li>
          <li>If you are a woman, it’s very important not to become pregnant while using isotretinoin gel or capsules or for at least one month after stopping. This is because isotretinoin can harm an unborn baby.</li>

        <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
        <p>Isotretinoin is a strong medicine so it's important to take the capsules as instructed by your doctor.</p>
        <p>Usually, isotretinoin capsules are taken once or twice a day. Each capsule contains a dose of 10mg or 20mg of isotretinoin.</p>
        <p>Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water. It’s best to take them straight after a meal or snack to make sure they work properly.</p>

          </summary>
          <div id="details-content-1" aria-hidden="false">
            <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
            <p>The dose of isotretinoin capsules varies from person to person and depends on your weight.</p>
            <p>As a general rule, the starting dose is 0.5 mg per kilogram body weight per day (0.5 mg/kg/day). So if you weigh 60 kg, your dose will usually start at 30 mg a day.</p>
            <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
            <p>If you take the capsules once a day and remember you have missed a dose on that day, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is the next day when you remember, skip the missed dose and have the next dose at the usual time.</p>
            <p>If you take the capsules twice a day and forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless this is within two hours of your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time.</p>
            <p>Never take a double dose or an extra dose to make up for a missed one.</p>
            <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
            <p>If you accidentally take too many isotretinoin capsules or someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact your pharmacist, NHS 111, your GP, or your nearest hospital immediately.</p>
            <h3>Will the amount I take go up or down?</h3>
            <p>After a few weeks your doctor may change your dose of capsules. For example, you may need a higher dose if your acne is not getting better. If you have any side effects that bother you, your doctor may lower your dose.</p>
          </div>
        </details>


        <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>
        <p>Like all medicines, isotretinoin capsules can cause side effects although not everyone gets them. Side effects will usually go away when you stop treatment.</p>
        <p>The most common side effects of isotretinoin capsules are headaches, aching muscles and joints, dry sensitive skin and skin sensitivity to sunlight.</p>
        <p>It has been reported that isotretinoin capsules can cause or worsen <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx">depression</a> and even make people feel suicidal. These reports are rare and it’s not clear if the medicine is the cause of the mental health illness or if it was there before. So far there is no clear link between this medicine and depression or suicidal behaviour.</p>

              <li>dry skin and lips – for safety, don’t have any waxing, dermabrasion or laser skin treatment while you are taking this medicine and for at least six months after you stop as this could cause scarring or skin irritation.</li>
              <li>skin becoming more sensitive to sunlight – for safety, try to stay out of bright sun and use a high factor sun cream (SPF 15 or above) even on cloudy days. Do not use a sun-lamp or sun-beds.</li>

            <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
            <p>Serious side effects are rare and happen in fewer than one in 1,000 people</p>
            <p>Stop taking isotretinoin capsules and tell a doctor straight away if you get:</p>

              <li><strong>stomach problems</strong> – severe pain in your tummy, with or without bloody diarrhoea, feeling sick and being sick can be signs of a serious and sometimes life-threatening problem called <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Pancreatitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">pancreatitis</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>a serious skin rash</strong> that peels or has blisters. The skin rash may come with eye infections, ulcers, a fever and headaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>muscle weakness </strong>– including difficulty moving your arms or legs and painful, swollen or bruised areas of the body. Dark pee can also be a sign of muscle weakness.</li>
              <li><strong>yellow skin or eyes</strong>, difficulty peeing or feeling very tired. These are all signs of liver or kidney problems.</li>

            <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
            <h4>What to do about headache, joint, muscle and back pain</h4>
            <p>Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Light exercise should not be a problem but try to avoid heavy exercise because it may make joint or muscle pain worse.</p>
            <h4>What to do about dry skin or lips</h4>
            <p>Apply a moisturiser and lip balm regularly. The best type of moisturiser is an oil-free face moisturiser for sensitive skin. Try and keep your showers shorter than two minutes and use lukewarm water rather than hot.</p>
            <h4>What to do about dry eyes</h4>
            <p>Ask your pharmacist or optician to recommend some eye drops. If you wear contact lenses and these become uncomfortable, you might have to wear glasses instead while you are taking this medicine.</p>
            <h4>What to do about dry mouth</h4>
            <p> Try chewing sugar free gum or sweets</p>
            <h4>What to do about dry nose and nosebleeds</h4>
            <p>Try applying a thin layer of Vaseline to the inside edges of your nose.</p>

            <div id="more-1" aria-hidden="true">
              <p>Isotretinoin capsules are only for severe acne. This is acne with lots of pus-filled spots that also affects the back and chest as well as the face.</p>
              <p>Isotretinoin capsules help severe acne by reducing the amount of natural oil made by your skin so blocked pores are less likely. The medicine also kills the bacteria that cause acne and relieves redness and soreness.</p>

              <p>Isotretinoin in the form of capsules is a powerful medicine generally reserved for people whose acne doesn't improve with other treatments.</p>
              <p>But there are other options for some people with severe acne, for example treatments that use lasers and other light devices and chemical peels.</p>

              <p>There are several lifestyle steps that can relieve even severe acne:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Try not to wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Too much washing can irritate your skin and make spots worse</li>
                <li>Wash spotty skin with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.</li>
                <li>Never ‘clean out’ blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scars.</li>
                <li>Don’t use too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as ‘non-comedogenic’ (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin).</li>
                <li>Remove make-up before going to bed.</li>
                <li>Use a fragrance-free, water-based moisturiser if dry skin is a problem</li>
                <li>Shower as soon as possible after exercising as sweat can irritate acne.</li>
                <li>Wash your hair regularly and try to stop letting your hair fall across your face.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Don't donate blood while taking isotretinoin capsules and for at least one month after stopping. If your blood is given to a pregnant woman it may harm her unborn baby.</p>
