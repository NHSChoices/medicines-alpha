      <p>Salbutamol is a type of medicine known as a bronchodilator or 'reliever' because it opens up the airways.</p>
      <p>It works very quickly to relieve symptoms of asthma and <abbr title="Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> such as coughing, wheezing and feeling breathless.</p>
      <p>Salbutamol is available only on prescription as an inhaler. It's sometimes given as tablets, capsules or syrup for people who can't use an inhaler very well.</p>
      <p>Salbutamol inhalers have various brand names including Airomir, Asmalal, Easyhaler, Pulvinal, Salamol,  Easi-Breathe, Salbulin and Ventolin.</p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts:</h2>
      <ul class="key-facts">
        <li>The salbutamol inhaler is usually blue.</li>
        <li>Salbutamol can be inhaled on demand to rapidly ease breathing difficulties in lung problems like asthma and COPD.</li>
        <li>Adults and children can have one or two puffs of a salbutamol inhaler up to a maximum of FOUR times in 24 hours.</li>
        <li>The most common side effect of salbutamol is feeling shaky.</li>
        <li>Salbutamol is generally considered safe to take as prescribed in pregnancy and while breastfeeding.
      </ul>


      <div class="disclaimer__info">
        <span class="disclaimer__info-icon"><span class="disclaimer__info-round">I<span class="disclaimer__info-hide">nfo: </span></span></span>
        <p class="disclaimer__info-text">Check the leaflet inside your medicine packet for specific information about the brand that you are taking.</p>
      </div>


      <h2 class="content__h2 noborder" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>The normal dose for adults and children is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ONE to TWO puffs of salbutamol <em class="strong">when you need it</em></li>
          <li>up to a maximum of <span class="strong">FOUR times</span> in 24 hours (regardless of whether you have one puff or two puffs at a time)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In a sudden, serious asthma attack you can take a larger dose of salbutamol of up to 10 puffs (waiting 15 to 30 seconds between puffs). You can repeat this dose 10 minutes later.</p>
      </ul>

      <p class="callout">Asthma attacks can get worse very quickly. If you or your child are struggling to breathe or have asthma symptoms that are not getting better, go to hospital immediately or call an ambulance.</p>

      <p>Salbutamol is sometimes prescribed to prevent breathing symptoms happening in the first place. This could be before a trigger such as exercise or pets. In this situation, the normal dose is still ONE to TWO puffs at a time.</p>

          <p>You may have been told that on a day-to-day basis you can use your inhaler as often as you need to. However, unless you have specifically been advised to use it more than four times in 24 hours it probably means that your health problem is getting worse and that you may need additional treatment.</p>

          <p>You are also more likely to get side effects such as increased heart rate, jitteriness, nervousness and headaches if you increase the number of times you use the medicine.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p>Make an appointment to see your doctor or nurse if you need:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>more than eight puffs of your inhaler in 24 hours</li>
              <li>to use your inhaler on more than two days of each week</li>
              <li>to use your inhaler in the middle of the night at least once a week</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>You may notice that your heart is beating more quickly than normal and that you feel shaky, but these effects should wear off after a few hours.</p>
          <p><em class="strong">Contact your doctor for advice if you’re worried.</em></p>

          <h3>Serious asthma attacks</h3>
          <p>Salbutamol can be given through a nebuliser to treat severe asthma attacks. A nebuliser is a machine that delivers it as a mist inhaled through a face mask.</p>

          <h3>Salbutamol tablets and syrup</h3>
          <p>Salbutamol tablets or syrup don't start to work very quickly so you will need to take them regularly to help keep your airways open all the time.</p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="using-inhaler">Using your inhaler</h2>
      <p>Your salbutamol inhaler should work almost straight away to make your breathing easier.</p>
      <p>It's important that you're familiar with your inhaler and know how to use it properly so you're getting all the benefits from your medicine.</p>

            <h3>Using the inhaler properly</h3>
            <p>Before using your inhaler, read the manufacturer's printed information leaflet from inside the pack. This leaflet gives you information and diagrams to show you how to use the inhaler, how to keep it clean, and how long to use it before getting a replacement.</p>
            <p>It's very important that you use your <span class="strong">inhaler properly</span> so you so you <span class="strong">get the right amount of salbutamol into your lungs</span>.</p>

            <p class="callout">If you’re not sure how to use your inhaler, ask your doctor or nurse to show you.</p>
            <p>They might suggest you use a different type of inhaler or they may give you a spacer.</p>

            <h3>Using a spacer with the inhaler</h3>
            <p>If you or your child find it difficult to use an inhaler, your doctor may give you a 'spacer' device to use with it.</p>
            <p>A spacer is a large metal or plastic container with a mouthpiece and a hole for the inhaler. When used with the inhaler it makes it easier to get the right amount of salbutamol into the lungs.</p>
            <p>Spacers are especially useful for giving salbutamol to young children. They're also helpful for people who find it difficult to co-ordinate breathing in and pressing an inhaler at the same time.</p>
            <p>Your doctor or nurse can show you how to use a spacer with the inhaler.</p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="not-be-able">Before using it</h2>
      <p>Salbutamol isn't suitable for people with certain health problems. And sometimes it should only be used if extra care is taken.</p>
      <p class="strong">Check with your doctor before starting to take salbutamol if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have an allergy to salbutamol or any other medicine or their ingredients</li>
        <li>take any other medicines including any pharmacy, herbal remedies or supplements</li>
        <li>have a rare inherited digestive disorder of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactase maladsorption. This is because many salbutamol products contain lactose. You should not have lactose if you have these illnesses. The amount of lactose in salbutamol products is too small to be a problem for people with lactose intolerance.</li>
        <li>are trying to become pregnant, are already pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
      </ul>



      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>
      <p>Salbutamol is a safe medicine if you use it properly. As it's usually delivered directly to the lungs, it's less likely to cause side effects.</p>

          <h3>Common side effects</h3>
          <p>Common salbutamol side effects (these affect up to one in 10 people) are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>feeling shaky</li>
            <li>feeling nervous and excitable</li>
            <li>getting a headache</li>

          <p>These side effects should soon pass.</p>
          <p>Contact your doctor or get medical help if these or any other side effects bother you or don’t go away.</p>

          <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
          <p>It happens rarely, but some people may have very serious side effects when taking salbutamol.</p>

          <p><em class="strong">Tell a doctor straight away if you develop:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li>low potassium levels: warning signs include muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps, or a heartbeat that doesn't feel normal</li>
            <li>very bad dizziness or passing out</li>
            <li>chest pain, a fast heartbeat or a heartbeat that doesn't feel normal</li>
            <li>very bad headache</li>

          <h3>Serious allergic reaction</h3>
          <p class="callout">It’s rare to have an allergic reaction to salbutamol but if this happens, stop taking the medicine and contact a doctor straight away.</p>
          <p>The warning signs of an allergic reaction are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>skin rash</li>
            <li>wheezing</li>
            <li>tightness in the chest or throat</li>
            <li>having trouble breathing or talking</li>
            <li>unusual hoarseness</li>

          <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
          <p>Some of the common side effects of salbutamol will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">What to do about feeling shaky:</span> see if your asthma or COPD symptoms get better with just one puff of your inhaler rather than two. If you find you need two puffs for symptom relief, be reassured that the shakiness will wear off after a short time.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">What to do about dizziness:</span> if salbutamol makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or staying seated until you feel better again.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Take care driving or using tools or machines:</span> if you get side effects such as dizziness, a fast or uneven heart rate, muscle cramps or muscle pain, or if you simply feel a bit shaky, until these symptoms pass.</p>

          <h3>Report a side effect</h3>
          <p>The Yellow Card Scheme collects information about the side effects of medicines. You can either report the side effect online through the <a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="link__external">Yellow Card website</a>, or on a yellow report card which you can get from your pharmacist.</p>

          <p>The risks of uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy are much higher than the risks of using medicines to prevent asthma attacks.</p>
          <p>Although most women with asthma have healthy babies, having uncontrolled asthma attacks can prevent your baby from getting enough oxygen and increase your risk of problems during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Salbutamol may pass into breast milk in very small amounts.</p>
          <p>In general salbutamol inhalers can be used as normal while breastfeeding because the amount of medicine that passes into breast milk after using the inhaler is so small that it's unlikely to harm the baby.</p>

            <p>Almost everyone that has asthma or COPD will be prescribed a bronchodilator medicine to use for symptom relief.</p>
            <p>There are two main bronchodilators available:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>salbutamol</li>
            <li>terbutaline</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Salbutamol and terbutaline are very similar in terms of how well they work and their safety but there may be differences in the kind of inhalers they come in.</p>
            <p>If you have difficulty using a salbutamol inhaler talk to your doctor as switching to a terbutaline inhaler may be an option.</p>
