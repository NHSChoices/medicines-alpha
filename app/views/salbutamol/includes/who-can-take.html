  <p>Salbutamol can be taken by adults and children.</p>
  <p>Salbutamol isn't suitable for people with certain health problems.</p>
  <p><strong>Check with your doctor before starting to take salbutamol if you:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>have an allergy to salbutamol or any other medicine</li>
    <li>take any other medicines including any pharmacy remedies, herbal remedies or supplements</li>
    <li>have a rare inherited digestive disorder of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactase maladsorption. This is because many salbutamol products contain lactose. You should not have lactose if you have these illnesses. The amount of lactose in salbutamol products is too small to be a problem for people with lactose intolerance</li>
    <li>are trying to become pregnant, are already pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
  </ul>
