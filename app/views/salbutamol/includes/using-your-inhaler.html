      <h3>Using a spacer with the inhaler</h3>
      <p>If you or your child find it difficult to use an inhaler, your doctor may give you a spacer to use with it.</p>
      <p>A spacer is a large metal or plastic container with a mouthpiece and a hole for the inhaler. When used with the inhaler it makes it easier to get the right amount of salbutamol into the lungs.</p>
      <p>Spacers are especially useful for giving salbutamol to young children. They're also helpful for people who find it difficult to co-ordinate breathing in and pressing an inhaler at the same time.</p>
      <p>Your doctor or nurse can show you how to use a spacer with the inhaler.</p>
