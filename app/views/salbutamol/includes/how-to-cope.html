  <p>Some of the common side effects of salbutamol will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="strong"><strong>feeling shaky</strong> </span> - see if your asthma or COPD symptoms get better with just one puff of your inhaler rather than two. If you find you need two puffs for symptom relief, be reassured that the shakiness will wear off after a short time</li>
    <li><strong>dizziness</strong> - if salbutamol makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or staying sitting down until you feel better again</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="infobanner">You can <a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">report any suspected side effect</a> to a UK safety scheme.</span></p>
