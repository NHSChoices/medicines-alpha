      <p>Fluoxetine is a type of antidepressant known as an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).</p>
      <p>It is often used to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Depression">depression</a>, and also sometimes <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obsessive-compulsive-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Obsessive compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>.</p>
      <p>Fluoxetine helps many people recover from depression, and it has fewer unwanted effects than older antidepressants.</p>
      <p>It is also called Prozac.</p>
      
      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul class="key-facts">
        <li>It usually takes 4-6 weeks to feel the full benefits of fluoxetine.</li>
        <li>Common side effects include feeling sick, headache and trouble sleeping, but tend to be mild and pass after a couple of weeks.</li>
        <li>Fluoxetine can affect an unborn baby. Tell your doctor straight away if you’re trying to get pregnant or become pregnant while taking it.</li>
        <li>Fluoxetine can cause withdrawal symptoms so don’t stop taking it without talking to your doctor.</li>
        <li>You can drink alcohol while taking fluoxetine but it might make you feel sleepy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>Take fluoxetine once a day. You can choose to take it at any time, as long as you stick to the same time every day. You can take fluoxetine with or without food.</p>
      <p>The usual dose of fluoxetine in adults is 20mg daily.</p>
      <p>If you are taking fluoxetine as a liquid medicine, a 5ml spoonful is the same as taking one 20mg capsule.</p>

  <p class="disclaimer__info-text">These are not all the side effects of fluoxetine. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.</p>

<h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
<p>Some of the common side effects of fluoxetine will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What to do about feeling sick or indigestion:</strong> take fluoxetine with food and plenty of water.</li>
<li><strong>What to do about feeling sleepy:</strong> avoid driving or using tools or machinery until the sleepiness wears off. Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink.</li>
<li><strong>What to do if you’re unable to sleep:</strong> take fluoxetine first thing in the morning.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can lessen the chance of having a side effect if you take fluoxetine in the evening so that you're asleep when the level of medicine in your body is highest.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/Diabetes.aspx" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a> fluoxetine can upset its control. Monitor your blood glucose more often for the first few weeks of treatment with fluoxetine and adjust your diabetes treatment if necessary.</p>
<p>If you have a side effect from any medicine, including fluoxetine, you can report it using the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1962.aspx?CategoryID=73&amp;SubCategoryID=101" title="Yellow Card Scheme">Yellow Card Scheme</a>. </p>

            <p>Antidepressants, including fluoxetine, are just one of several approaches to treating depression. Other potential treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)</li>
                <li>exercise programmes</li>
                <li>help to get a good night's sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on how long you have had depression, your symptoms, whether you have had any previous bouts of depression, whether previous treatment has worked, how likely you are to stick with your treatment, the potential side effects and your preferences and priorities.</p>

            <p>Don’t stop taking fluoxetine unless your doctor tells you to.</p>
            <p>If you stop taking fluoxetine suddenly you may get unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. These include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>dizziness</li>
            <li>nausea</li>
            <li>numbness or tingling in the hands or feet</li>
            <li>trouble sleeping</li>
            <li>feeling agitated or anxious</li>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>shaking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Withdrawal symptoms are usually harmless and over within a few days but it's possible to prevent them by reducing the dose gradually when you stop taking this medicine.</p>
