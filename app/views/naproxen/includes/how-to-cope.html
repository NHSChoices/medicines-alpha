  <h3>What to do about:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>indigestion</strong> - if <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Indigestion/Pages/Introduction.aspx">indigestion</a> starts or gets worse after you take naproxen, stop taking it and see your doctor as soon as possible. If you need something to ease the discomfort, try taking an <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antacid-medicines/Pages/Definition.aspx">antacid</a>, but don’t put off going to the doctor.</li>
    <li><strong>feeling sick</strong> - it may help if you stick to simple meals and don’t eat rich or spicy food. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.</li>
    <li><strong>diarrhoea and vomiting</strong> - drink plenty of water if you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diarrhoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx">diarrhoea</a> or if you are vomiting – have small, frequent sips. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions. You can buy these from a pharmacy or supermarket to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx">dehydration</a>. Don’t take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea or vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.  If you have blood in your vomit, tell your doctor straight away.</li>
    <li><strong>constipation</strong> - if you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx">constipation</a>, eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Also exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.</li>
    <li><strong>wind</strong> - too much wind (<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flatulence/Pages/Introduction.aspx">flatulence</a>) can usually be reduced by changing your diet and lifestyle, such as not eating foods that cause wind (like pulses, lentils, beans and onions), eating smaller meals, eating and drinking slowly, and exercising regularly. You can also buy medicines that help wind from a shop or supermarket, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone.</li>
    <li><strong>skin being sensitive to sunlight</strong> - stay out of bright sun and use a high factor sun cream (SPF 15 or above) even on cloudy days. Do not use a sun-lamp or sun-beds</li>
  </ul>
