  <p>There are some medicines that interfere with the way metformin works.</p>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal remedies and supplements, before starting metformin.</span></p>
  <p>If you are taking any of the following medicines, your blood sugar levels may need to be checked more often and your dose adjusted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>steroid tablets such as prednisolone</li>
    <li>water tablets such as furosemide</li>
    <li>medicines to treat heart problems and high blood pressure</li>
    <li>male and female hormones such as testosterone, oestrogen and progesterone</li>
    <li>other diabetes medicines</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some women might need a small adjustment in their metformin dose after starting contraceptive pills. That's because contraceptive pills change how your body handles glucose.</p>
