          <p>Metformin can cause vitamin B12 deficiency if you take it for a long time. Your doctor will regularly check the vitamin B12 level in your blood.  If you become deficient, this can be treated by taking vitamin B12 supplements.</p>

          <h3>Is there any food or drink to avoid?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-13" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>sweets</li>
            <li>cakes</li>

          <p>Karela (also called bitter gourd) is used to flavour foods such as curries such as bitter gourd masala. It has a bitter taste and is also made into juice and tea.</p>
          <p>Be careful eating food and drink containing karela because it can lower your blood sugar levels and mean your diabetes isn't controlled as well as it should be.</p>
