      <h2>Stopping prednisolone</h2>

      <p>If you've taken prednisolone for more than three weeks or have taken more than 40mg every day for more than a week it's very important that you do not go 'cold turkey' and stop taking the medicine suddenly.</p>
      <p>This is because:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>suddenly stopping the medicine may lead to your condition flaring up again even though it appears to be under control</li>
        <li>you may have dangerous withdrawal symptoms such as severe fatigue, weakness, body aches and joint pain</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Prednisolone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisolone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production.</p>
      <p>To prevent withdrawal symptoms, gradually reduce the prednisolone dose over a few weeks. By tapering the dose in this way your adrenal glands have time to resume their normal function.</p>
      <p>If you were on prednisolone for less than three weeks itâ€™s alright to stop suddenly.</p>
