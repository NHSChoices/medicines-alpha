      <p>As prednisolone is used to treat many different conditions, itâ€™s difficult to say when you might expect to benefit. For some inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, you would expect to see improvement within a couple of days. However, for some conditions, such as after an organ transplant, you may be taking prednisolone to stop your symptoms getting worse or to prevent a problem, such as organ rejection, happening.</p>
      <p><em class="strong">Please ask your doctor what to expect for your particular medical condition.</em></p>
