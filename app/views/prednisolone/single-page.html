      <p>Prednisolone is a type of medicine known as a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Corticosteroid-(drugs)/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">corticosteroid</a> or steroid. Corticosteroids are not the same as <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anabolic-steroid-abuse/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">anabolic steroids</a>.</p>
      <p>Prednisolone is used to treat a wide range of health problems including allergies, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Arthritis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">arthritis</a>, blood disorders, skin diseases, infections, certain cancers and to prevent organ rejection after a transplant.</p>
      <p>Prednisolone is available only on prescription as tablets, a liquid to drink and as eye and ear drops. It can also be given by injection but this is usually only done in hospital.</p>
      <p>It’s also called by the brand names Deltacortril, Deltastab, Dilacort and Pevanti.</p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Take prednisolone once a day in the morning.</li>
        <li>Prednisolone can cause withdrawal problems. Do not stop the medicine suddenly if you’ve been on it for more than a few weeks.</li>
        <li>Taking prednisolone can make you more likely to get infections. Tell your doctor if you're exposed to infectious illnesses like chickenpox or shingles.</li>
        <li>The most common side effects of prednisolone are weight gain, indigestion, insomnia and sweating a lot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="infobanner">Check the leaflet inside your medicine packet for information about the brand that you are taking.</span></p>


      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>Prednisolone is a strong medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor has instructed.</p>
      <p>The usual dose of prednisolone varies between 5mg and 60mg daily.</p>
      <p>It's usual to take prednisolone as a single dose once a day straight after breakfast. For example, if your dose is 40mg daily, it's usual to take 8 tablets (8 x 5mg) all at the same time.</p>

      <details role="group">
        <summary class="more-info" role="button" aria-controls="details-content-1" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="true" onclick="try {trackHTML('How and when to take - more');} catch(e) {}">
          <span>More information</span>
        </summary>
        <div id="details-content-1" aria-hidden="false">
          <p>It’s best to take prednisolone with breakfast so it doesn't upset your stomach. If you have enteric coated (red or brown) tablets, you can take these with or without food.</p>
          <p>Taking prednisolone in the morning also means it's less likely to affect your sleep.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, you may be advised to take prednisolone on alternate days only.</p>
          <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
          <p>The dose depends on your illness and whether you are taking prednisolone as a short course or for longer.</p>
          <p>In children, the dose may be lower than for an adult with the same illness because it is calculated according to their height and weight.</p>
          <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
          <p>Once your illness starts to get better, it's likely that your dose will go down.</p>
          <p>Your doctor will probably reduce your dose before you stop treatment completely.</p>
          <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
          <p>If you miss a dose of predisolone, take it as soon as you remember. If you don't remember until the following day, skip the missed dose.</p>
          <p>Don't take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>Taking too many prednisolone tablets by accident is unlikely to harm you.</p>
          <p>If you're worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
        </div>
      </details>



      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>
      <p>The higher the dose of prednisolone that you take, the greater the chance of side effects. You are less likely to get side effects if you take a relatively low dose of less than 20mg prednisolone daily.</p>
      <p>Some side effects, such as stomach upset or mood changes, can happen straight away. Others, such as getting a rounder face, happen after weeks or months.</p>
      <h3>Common side effects</h3>
      <p>These common side effects affect up to one in 10 people. Keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother you or don't go away:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>weight gain</li>
        <li>indigestion</li>
        <li>not able to sleep</li>
        <li>restlessness</li>
        <li>sweating a lot</li>
        <li>bone problems</li>

          <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
          <p>Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than one in 10,000 people.</p>
          <p>You are more likely to have a serious side effect if you take a higher dose (more than 20mg daily) of prednisolone or if you have been taking it for more than a few weeks.</p>
          <p>Tell a doctor straight away if you get:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>an infection - warning signs include fever, chills, very sore throat, ear or sinus pain, a cough, more saliva or change in colour of saliva, pain with passing urine, mouth sores, or wound that will not heal</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Hyperglycaemia/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">high blood sugar</a> -  warning signs include feeling sleepy or confused, feeling very thirsty or hungry, passing urine more often, flushing, breathing quickly, or breath that smells like fruit</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cushings-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">Cushing's syndrome</a> - warning signs include weight gain in the upper back or belly, moon face, very bad headache, and slow wound healing</li>

            <li>low potassium levels - warning signs include muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps, or a heartbeat that does not feel normal</li>
            <li>pancreas problems - warning signs include severe stomach pain, severe back pain, severe upset stomach or vomiting</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You should also tell a doctor straight away if you get:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>breathless</li>
            <li>swelling in your arms or legs</li>
            <li>changes in your eyesight</li>
            <li>any bruising or bleeding that isn’t normal</li>
            <li>black poo</li>
            <li>black or dark brown vomit or vomiting blood</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Serious allergic reaction</h4>
          <p><span class="alertbanner">It's extremely rare to have an allergic reaction to prednisolone but if this happens to you, stop taking the medicine and contact a doctor straight away.</span></p>
          <p>The warning signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">serious allergic reaction</a> are:</p>

            <li>swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Stunted growth in children</h3>
          <p>Long periods of prednisolone treatment can slow down the normal growth of children and teenagers.</p>
          <p>Your child's doctor will watch their growth carefully while they are taking steroids. That way any slowing of growth can be picked up promptly and treatment changed if necessary.</p>
          <p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of giving prednisolone to your child if you are concerned.</p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-to-cope">Coping with side effects</h2>
      <h3>What to do about stomach problems</h3>
      <p>Take prednisolone with food to reduce the chances of indigestion, nausea or vomiting. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food while you're taking this medicine. If symptoms carry on, ask your doctor if you may benefit from taking an additional medicine to protect your stomach.</p>
      <h3>What to do about weight gain</h3>
      <p>Prednisolone can make you hungrier so it can be quite challenging to keep from putting on weight while you're taking it. Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes so you don't gain too much weight. Regular exercise will also help to keep your weight stable.</p>
      <h3>What to do to protect your bones</h3>
      <p>Taking prednisolone for a long time can increase the risk of <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Osteoporosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">osteoporosis</a> - when bones become thinner and have a higher chance of breaking. Take regular exercise and make sure you get enough calcium in your diet to help strengthen your bones. Calcium-rich foods include milk, cheese and leafy greens.</p>
      <p><span class="infobanner">You can <a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">report any suspected side effect</a> to a UK safety scheme.</span></p>


      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="taking-with-others">Taking prednisolone with other medicines</h2>
      <p>There are some medicines that interfere with the way prednisolone works.</p>
      <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any other medicines, including herbal remedies and supplements, before starting prednisolone.</span></p>

      <p>Prednisolone is not usually recommended in pregnancy unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks.</p>

This can reduce the symptoms of inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Asthma/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">asthma</a>.</p>
            <p>Steroids also damp down your immune system, which can help in 'autoimmune' illnesses, like rheumatoid arthritis, where your immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.</p>

            <p>Taking prednisolone for many months or years can have several harmful effects on your body. It can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>thinner bones</li>
              <li>poorly controlled <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/Diabetes.aspx" class="link__external">diabetes</a></li>
              <li>eyesight problems</li>
              <li>slower growth and development in children and teenagers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To check your bones, your doctor may arrange for you to have an occasional bone scan.</p>
            <p>If you have diabetes, you may need to check your blood glucose more often. Your doctor can advise you more about this.</p>
            <p>To reduce the chances of eyesight problems, try to visit an optometrist every 12 months to check for high pressure in your eye (<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Glaucoma/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">glaucoma</a>) and cataract.</p>
            <p>To reduce the long-term effects of prednisolone on growth, children and teenagers will have their height monitored regularly so that any slowing of growth can be picked up promptly.</p>
