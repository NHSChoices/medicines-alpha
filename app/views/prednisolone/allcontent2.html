      <h2>About prednisolone</h2>

      <p>Prednisolone is a type of medicine known as a corticosteroid or 'steroid'. It works by damping down the immune system to reduce inflammation.</p>

      <p>Prednisolone is used to treat a wide range of conditions including allergies, inflammatory diseases (for example affecting the eyes, bowels, joints, skin or lungs), skin diseases, infections, certain cancers and to prevent organ rejection after a transplant.</p>

      <p>Prednisolone is available only on prescription as tablets, an oral solution or liquid eye and ear drops. It can also be given by injection but this is usually only done in hospital.</p>

      <p>Its brand names include Deltacortril, Deltastab, Dilacort, Pevanti.</p>

      <h4>What to do:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><em class="strong">stop taking prednisolone and seek medical help URGENTLY</em> if you have any of these side effects</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Side effects after stopping prednisolone</h3>
      <p><em class="strong">Call your doctor or get medical help URGENTLY if</em> you have recently stopped taking prednisolone and you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>start to feel very tired, weak, trembling</li>
        <li>have a fast heartbeat and feel confused, sweaty or dizzy</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
      <p><span class="strong">What to do about weight gain</span>: It can be quite challenging to maintain your normal body weight because you are likely to find that prednisolone will make you want to eat more than normal. To keep weight gain to a minimum, try to eat a healthy balanced diet including foods that contain calcium, and exercise regularly.</p>
      <p><span class="strong">What to do about indigestion</span>: Take prednisolone with food to reduce the chances that it will cause indigestion, nausea or vomiting. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food while you are taking this medicine. If symptoms persist talk with your doctor as it is possible that you will also need another type of medicine prescribed to help protect your stomach.</p>
      <p><span class="strong">What to do about bone loss</span>: Although you may not feel any different, prednisolone, if used for more than a few months, can lead to bone loss and this in turn increases your risk of fractures. If you take prednisolone long term, your bones may be monitored with occasional hospital scans. To reduce the chance of bone problems, try to eat a healthy balanced diet including foods that contain calcium, and exercise regularly.</p>


      <h2>Interactions</h2>

      <h3>Will prednisolone mix badly with other medicines?</h3>
      <p>There are many medicines which can be affected by prednisolone so it's not possible to list of all the ones you should be especially concerned about.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some medicines can speed up how quickly prednisolone is broken down by the body, which can result in it not working as well as it should.</li>
        <li>Some medicines can slow down how quickly prednisolone is broken down and this can increase the chances that you might have side effects.</li>
        <li>Some medicines cause similar side effects to prednisolone and taking them together can increase your chances of having that side effect.</li>
        <li>Some of the side effects seen with prednisolone can mean that other medicines you take may not work as well as expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What to do:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure that your doctor and pharmacist know you are taking prednisolone before starting or stopping any other medicine (including those bought over the counter).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Will prednisolone interact with food or alcohol?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prednisolone can interact with alcohol, so it may be advisable to reduce or preferably avoid alcohol while taking it.</li>
        <li>You don't have to change your diet while taking prednisolone, however, you should avoid eating liquorice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Will prednisolone interact with complementary medicines?</h3>
      <p>There are many complementary medicines that can be affected by prednisolone and it is not possible to provide a list of all the ones you should be especially concerned about.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some complementary medicines can speed up how quickly prednisolone is broken down by the body which can result in prednisolone not working as well as it should.</li>
        <li>Some complementary medicines can slow down how quickly prednisolone is broken down and this can increase the chances that you might experience side effects.</li>
        <li>Some complementary medicines cause similar side effects to prednisolone and taking them together can increase your chances of having that side effect.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What to do:</h4>
      <p>Make sure that your doctor and pharmacist knows you are taking prednisolone before starting or stopping <em class="strong">any</em> complementary medicine.</p>


      <h2>Dosage</h2>

      <p>In an adult the dose of prednisolone can vary between 5mg and 60mg every day depending on the condition being treated and whether the medicine is prescribed as a short course or as a regular medicine.</p>
      <p>In children and adolescents the dose depends on both the condition being treated and either weight or surface area (which reflects both weight and height).</p>
      <p>Prednisolone may be prescribed to be taken as a short course of treatment and sometimes the dose prescribed may be reduced over that course as your symptoms improve. In some cases, prednisolone may be prescribed to take regularly over a longer period.</p>

      <p><em class="strong">What to do:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>for a short course of prednisolone, follow the dosage instructions you have been given and complete the course as prescribed even if you feel better before the course is complete</li>
        <li>if you’re taking prednisolone for longer, take the medicine regularly until your doctor tells you to stop</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>How to take it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Take prednisolone tablets or solution as a single dose in the morning with food. If you are taking enteric coated tablets you can take them with or without food. Sometimes prednisolone is prescribed to be taken on alternate days only.</li>
        <li>If you miss a dose of prednisolone, take it as soon as you remember to unless it is close to the time for your next dose in which case skip the missed dose and go back to your normal time. <em class="strong">Do not take two doses at the same time or extra doses</em>.</li>
        <li>Taking too much prednisolone on a one-off basis is unlikely to be harmful, but if you’re concerned contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>When will I feel better?</h2>

      <p>As prednisolone is used to treat many different conditions, it’s difficult to say when you might expect to benefit. For some inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, you would expect to see improvement within a couple of days. However, for some conditions, such as after an organ transplant, you may be taking prednisolone to stop your symptoms getting worse or to prevent a problem, such as organ rejection, happening.</p>
      <p><em class="strong">Please ask your doctor what to expect for your particular medical condition.</em></p>


      <h2>Taking prednisolone in pregnancy and when breastfeeding</h2>

      <p><em class="strong">Prednisolone may not be safe to take in pregnancy.</em></p>

      <p>Prednisolone may cause problems when used in the first trimester of pregnancy and may also affect the growth of the unborn baby.</p>
      <p>Consult with your doctor immediately if you intend to become pregnant or become pregnant whilst taking this medicine.</p>

      <p><em class="strong">Prednisolone may not be safe to take while breastfeeding.</em></p>

      <p>If prednisolone is taken in high doses by a breastfeeding mother, the baby may need to be monitored for signs of side effects.</p>

      <p>It may help to wait four hours between taking a dose of prednisolone and breastfeeding. Alternatively, express sufficient breast milk just before taking a dose of prednisolone to cover the four-hour period after taking the dose.</p>


      <h2>Other treatment options</h2>

      <p>There are unlikely to be treatments available as an alternative to prednisolone.</p>

      <p>Other corticosteroids (for example deflazacort, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and prednisone) are available but they are similar to prednisolone in terms of effectiveness or safety.</p>

      <p>Sometimes it is possible to switch from prednisolone tablets to a locally acting steroid medicine to reduce the risk of side effects, for example someone with asthma may be switched from tablets to a steroid inhaler.</p>

      <h2>Living with prednisolone</h2>

      <p>Taking prednisolone shouldn't affect your normal daily routine too much although it's a good idea to cut down on or avoid alcohol completely while you’re taking it.</p>

      <p>Be prepared to experience some troublesome side effects, particularly if you take a high dose and/or for longer than a couple of weeks. Here are some simple lifestyle changes you can make to lessen side effects and help you stay healthy while taking prednisolone:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">Prevent stomach problems</span><span class="hidden"> - </span> Try taking prednisolone with food to reduce the chances that it will give you indigestion, nausea or vomiting. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food while you’re taking this medicine. If symptoms persist, ask your doctor if you may benefit from taking an additional medicine to help protect your stomach.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">Limit weight gain</span><span class="hidden"> - </span> Prednisolone can make you hungrier so it can be quite challenging to avoid putting on weight while you’re taking it. Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes so you don’t gain too much weight. Regular exercise will also help to keep your weight stable.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">Protect your bones</span><span class="hidden"> - </span> Taking prednisolone for a long time can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is when bones become thin and have a higher chance of breaking. Take regular exercise and make sure you get enough calcium in your diet to help strengthen your bones. Calcium-rich foods include milk, cheese and leafy greens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Blue steroid treatment card</h3>

      <p>If you're likely to be taking prednisolone for longer than three weeks (or you've been prescribed a high dose of more than 40mg daily) you will be given a blue steroid treatment card. Carry this card around with you and show it to any healthcare professional treating you. The card has advice on how to reduce the risks of side effects and provides details of the prescriber, drug, dosage and the duration of treatment.</p>

      <h3>Tests and monitoring</h3>

      <p>If you will be taking prednisolone for a long time, you'll probably have regular tests to monitor your blood pressure, weight, blood sugar and potassium levels.</p>
      <p>Your doctor may also arrange for you to have an occasional bone scan to check for any bone loss.</p>
      <p>If you have diabetes you may need to have your blood sugar measured more frequently, as prednisolone tablets may affect the levels of sugar in your blood.</p>
      <p>Prednisolone can increase your risk of eyesight problems over time, so if you're taking prednisolone long-term, it's important to visit an optometrist every 6-12 months to check for high pressure in your eye (glaucoma) and cataract.</p>
