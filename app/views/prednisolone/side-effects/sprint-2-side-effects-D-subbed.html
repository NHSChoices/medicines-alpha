      <h2>Possible side effects</h2>

      <p>Like all medicines, prednisolone can cause side effects in some people but don't worry, not everyone gets them.</p>

      <p>You're more likely to experience side effects if you take prednisolone as tablets and in a higher dose (more than 10mg/day).</p>

      <p>Some side effects such as mood changes or stomach problems can happen straight away. Others, like weight gain, only happen after weeks or months.</p>

      <p>If you feel unwell while taking prednisolone, keep taking your tablets, but tell your doctor straight away.</p>
