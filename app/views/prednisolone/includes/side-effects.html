      <h3>Stunted growth in children</h3>
      <p>Long periods of prednisolone treatment can slow down the normal growth of children and teenagers.</p>
      <p>Your child's doctor will watch their growth carefully while they are taking steroids. That way any slowing of growth can be picked up promptly and treatment changed if necessary.</p>
      <p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of giving prednisolone to your child if you are concerned.</p>
