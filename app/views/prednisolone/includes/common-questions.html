          <h3>When will I feel better?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-2" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>This can vary.</p>
          <p>For some illnesses, you will feel better after a couple of days.</p>
          <p>For other illnesses, you may not feel any better even though the medicine is helping you. This may be the case if youâ€™re taking prednisolone to stop your symptoms getting worse or to prevent a problem happening (for example after an organ transplant).</p>
          <p>Ask your doctor what to expect for your illness.</p>

        </summary>
        <div id="questions-4" aria-hidden="true">
