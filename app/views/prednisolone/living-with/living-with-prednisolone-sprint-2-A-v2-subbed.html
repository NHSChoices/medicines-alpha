      <h2>Living with prednisolone</h2>

      <p>Prednisolone treatment should not greatly affect normal daily routine for the majority of people, although it may be advisable to reduce or preferably avoid alcohol while taking this medicine.</p>

      <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>

      <p>Severe side effects are rare when taking a short course of steroid tablets. Prolonged treatment at high doses can cause problems in some people. For example:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><span class="strong">Indigestion, nausea or vomiting</span> - Taking prednisolone with food will reduce the chances that it will cause stomach upsets. Avoiding rich or spicy food can also help. If stomach problems persist, an additional medicine can be prescribed to protect the stomach.</li>
      <li><span class="strong">Weight gain</span> - Prednisolone increases appetite which can potentially lead to weight gain. To keep weight gain to a minimum it’s important to eat a healthy balanced diet, control portion size, and do regular exercise where possible.</li>
      <li><span class="strong">Bone thinning</span> - Taking prednisolone for a long time can cause bone thinning. A diet containing calcium-rich foods such as dairy foods and leafy greens will help to protect bone strength. Regular exercise is also recommended.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Blue steroid treatment card</h3>
      <p>If prednisolone has been prescribed for longer than three weeks (or at a high dose of more than 40mg daily) a blue steroid treatment card will be issued. It’s important that this card is carried with you and shown to any healthcare professional that is providing treatment. The card provides advice on how to reduce the risks of adverse effects and provides details of the prescriber, drug, dosage and the duration of treatment.</p>

      <h3>Tests and monitoring</h3>
      <p>Taking prednisolone for months or years increases the chances of certain side effects such as bone thinning and diabetes. Long term users of prednisolone should be monitored for side effects. This monitoring may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>regular checks of blood pressure, weight, blood sugar and potassium levels (if you have diabetes your blood glucose may be checked more frequently as prednisolone tablets may affect the levels of sugar in your blood)</li>
        <li>an occasional bone scan</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eyesight checks</h3>
      <p>Prednisolone, if taken long term, can increase the risk of certain eyesight conditions, so an optometrist should be visited every 6-12 months to check for high pressure in the eye (glaucoma) and cataract.</p>
