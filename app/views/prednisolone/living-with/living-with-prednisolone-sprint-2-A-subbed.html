      <h2>Living with prednisolone</h2>

      <p>For most people, prednisolone treatment should not affect normal daily routine too much, although it may be advisable to reduce or preferably avoid alcohol while taking this medicine.</p>

      <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>

      <p>There are not usually any severe side effects from taking a short course of steroid tablets. However, prolonged treatment at high doses can cause problems in some people. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Taking prednisolone with food will reduce the chances that it will cause stomach upsets such as indigestion, nausea or vomiting. It may also help to avoid rich or spicy food. If stomach problems persist, an additional medicine can be prescribed to protect the stomach.</li>
        <li>Prednisolone increases appetite which can potentially lead to weight gain. To keep weight gain to a minimum, it’s important to eat a healthy balanced diet, control portion size, and do regular exercise where possible.</li>
        <li>Taking prednisolone for a long time can cause bone thinning. To protect bone strength it’s important to eat a diet containing calcium-rich foods, such as dairy foods and leafy greens, and to exercise regularly where possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Blue steroid treatment card</h3>

      <p>If prednisolone has been prescribed for longer than three weeks (or at a high dose of more than 40mg daily) you will be given a blue steroid treatment card. It’s important that this card is carried around with you and shown to any healthcare professional that is treating you. The card provides advice on how to reduce the risks of adverse effects and provides details of the prescriber, drug, dosage and the duration of treatment.</p>

      <h3>Tests and monitoring</h3>

      <p>Taking prednisolone for months or years increases the chances of certain side effects such as bone thinning and diabetes.  Anyone taking prednisolone long term should be monitored for side effects. This monitoring may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>regular checks of blood pressure, weight, blood sugar and potassium levels (if you have diabetes your blood glucose may be checked more frequently as prednisolone tablets may affect the levels of sugar in your blood)</li>
        <li>an occasional bone scan</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eyesight checks</h3>
      <p>Prednisolone, if taken long term, can increase the risk of certain eyesight conditions, so it’s important to visit an optometrist every 6-12 months to check for high pressure in the eye (glaucoma) and cataract.</p>
