  <p>It’s best to give your child ibuprofen with or just after food to reduce their chance of getting an upset stomach. </p>

  <h3>How to give ibuprofen to a child</h3>
  <h4>Syrup</h4>
  <p>Shake the bottle well and measure out the right amount using a plastic syringe or spoon. These come in the medicine packet. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>
  <p>To hide the taste of liquid medicine, you can give the child a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after giving the medicine.</p>
  <h4>Tablets and capsules</h4>
  <p>Tablets and capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water or juice. Tell your child not to chew, break, crush or suck them as this could irritate their mouth or throat.</p>
  <h4>Granules</h4>
  <p>Sprinkle or stir the granules into a small amount of soft food (such as yogurt) or a small drink, or you can mix them with a spoonful of cold water. Do not mix the granules with warm food or liquid. Your child should then swallow the food or drink it straight away, without chewing. Make sure that they take it all. Do not keep the granule/food mixture to give later.</p>

  <h3>What if I forget to give it?</h3>
  <p>Give the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for their next dose. In this instance, skip the missed dose and give their next dose as usual.</p>
  <p>Never give a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>

  <h3>What if they take too much?</h3>
  <p>Giving your child too much ibuprofen by accident can be dangerous.</p>
  <p>If you think you may have given your child an extra dose of ibuprofen by mistake, wait at least 12 hours before giving them any more.</p>
  <p><strong>If your child may have had more than a double dose of ibuprofen, take them to hospital straight away.</strong></p>
  <p>It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to hospital if you can.</p>

      <p>Standard release tablets release gliclazide into your body quickly so you may need to take them several times a day depending on your dose.</p>
      <p>Extended release tablets dissolve slowly which means you don’t have to take them as regularly as the standard ones. One dose in the morning is usually enough.</p>
      <p>Your doctor or pharmacist will explain what type of gliclazide tablets you are on and how to take them.</p>
      <p>Swallow your gliclazide tablets whole with a glass of water, do not chew them.</p>
      <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
      <p>Your doctor will check your blood sugar levels regularly and may adjust your dose of gliclazide if necessary.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you miss a dose of gliclazide, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>
      <p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways that are suitable for you and your medicines.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>If you take too many gliclazide tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. An overdose of gliclazide can cause low blood sugar.</p>
      <p>If you think you have low blood sugar, have some food or drink that quickly gets sugar into your bloodstream such as sugar cubes or fruit juice. This type of sugar will not last long in your blood so you may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit. This will last longer.</p>
