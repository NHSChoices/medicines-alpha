      <p>If your child has pain all the time, your doctor may prescribe slow-release tablets or capsules. These are given once or twice a day. Your doctor will tell you how often to give the medicine.</p>
      <p>Give ibuprofen with food or milk to reduce stomach upset.</p>
      <h3>How much ibuprofen to give</h3>
      <p>Ibuprofen tablets, capsules, syrup and granules come in a range of strengths. Children need to take a lower dose than adults, depending on their age.</p>
      <p>As a general rule, babies and children can have ibuprofen syrup up to age 12 and beyond. While only children aged 6 and older can have tablets.  Granules are only for children aged 12 and older.</p>
      <p>If you are not sure how much to give, ask your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
      <h3>How to give ibuprofen to a child</h3>
      <h4>Syrup</h4>
      <p>Shake the bottle well and measure out the right amount using a plastic syringe or spoon. These come in the medicine packet. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>
      <p>To hide the taste of liquid medicine, you can give the child a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after giving the medicine.</p>
      <h4>Tablets and capsules</h4>
      <p>Tablets and capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water or juice. Tell your child not to chew, break, crush or suck them as this could irritate their mouth or throat.</p>
      <h4>Granules</h4>
      <p>Sprinkle or stir the granules into a small amount of soft food (such as yoghurt) or a small drink, or you can mix them with a spoonful of cold water. Do not mix the granules with warm food or liquid. Your child should then swallow the food or drink it straight away, without chewing. Make sure that they take it all. Do not keep the granule/food mixture to give later.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to give it?</h3>
      <p>Give the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for their next dose. In this instance, skip the missed dose and give their next dose as usual.</p>
      <p>Never give a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
      <h3>What if they take too much?</h3>
      <p>Giving your child too much ibuprofen by accident can be dangerous.</p>
      <p>If you think you may have given your child an extra dose of ibuprofen by mistake, wait at least 12 hours before giving them any more.</p>
      <p><span class="emergencybanner">If your child has had more than a double dose of ibuprofen, take them to hospital straight away.</span></p>
      <p>It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to hospital if you can.</p>
