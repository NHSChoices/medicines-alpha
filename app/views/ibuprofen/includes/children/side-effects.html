  <p>Ibuprofen can cause side effects. To reduce the chance of side effects, give your child the lowest dose for the shortest time to control their symptoms.</p>
  <h3>Common side effects</h3>

      <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
      <p>These serious side effects are rare and affect less than one in 10,000 people.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>liver disorder - warning signs include yellowing of the skin or whites of the eye</li>

        <li>eye disorders - your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment because of changes in your blood sugar levels</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Low blood sugar</h3>
      <p>Gliclazide can sometimes cause your blood sugar to go too low. The name for this is hypoglycaemia. Early warning signs of low blood sugar include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>feeling hungry</li>
        <li>trembling or shaking</li>
        <li>sweating</li>
        <li>confusion</li>
        <li>difficulty concentrating</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s also possible for your blood sugar to go too low while you’re asleep. If this happens, it can make you feel sweaty, tired and confused when you wake up.</p>
      <p>Low blood sugar may happen if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>eat meals irregularly or skip meals</li>
        <li>are fasting</li>
        <li>don’t eat a healthy diet with enough nutrients in</li>
        <li>change what you eat</li>
        <li>increase your physical activity without eating more to compensate</li>
        <li>drink alcohol, especially after skipping a meal</li>
        <li>take other medicines or natural remedies at the same time</li>
        <li>take too much gliclazide</li>
        <li>suffer from a hormone disorder such as hypothyroidism</li>
        <li>have kidney or liver problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Have regular meals, including breakfast, and never miss or delay a meal.</p>
      <p>If you are planning to increase your physical activity, eat carbohydrates (bread, pasta, cereals) before, during or after exercise.</p>
      <p>Always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice, or some sweets in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners won’t help. You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer</p>
      <p>If taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms come back, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital.</p>
      <p>Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the symptoms of low blood sugar level.</p>
