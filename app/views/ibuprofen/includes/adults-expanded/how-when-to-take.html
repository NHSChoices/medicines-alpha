  <h2 id="how-when" class="content__h2">How and when to take</h2>
  <p>Each tablet or capsule contains 200mg, 400mg, 600mg or 800mg of ibuprofen.</p>
  <p>The usual dose for adults is one or two 200mg tablets 3 times a day.</p>
  <p>Your doctor may recommend that you take a higher dose, up to 600mg four times a day. You should only take it 4 times a day if it is prescribed, not if you buy it.</p>
  <p>If you take ibuprofen 3 times a day, leave at least 6 hours between doses. If you take it 4 times a day, leave at least 4 hours between doses.</p>
  <p>Always take ibuprofen with food or a drink of milk to lessen the chance of an upset tummy.</p>
  <h3>How much to take by mouth</h3>
  <p>The dose of ibuprofen depends on the reason you are taking it, your age, if you have bought it or been prescribed it, if you have heart, kidney or liver problems, and how well it helps your symptoms.</p>
  <p>As a general rule when taking ibuprofen by mouth:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the usual dose is 200mg to 400mg three times a day</li>
    <li>your doctor may advise you to take a higher dose, up to 600mg four times a day. You should only take it 4 times a day if it is prescribed, not if you buy it</li>
    <li>the usual dose of the slow-release capsule is 300mg to 600mg twice a day at least 8 hours apart</li>
    <li>the usual dose of the slow-release tablet is 1,600mg to 2,400mg a day. If the dose is higher than 1,600mg a day, take it as 2 separate doses. This is only available on prescription</li>
    <li>the usual dose of the slow-release tablet is 1,600mg to 2,400mg a day. If the dose is higher than 1,600mg daily, take it as two separate doses. This is only available on prescription</li>
    <li>doses are usually lower for elderly people and people with heart, kidney or liver problems</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>How to take ibuprofen by mouth</h3>
  <p>Swallow ibuprofen tablets or capsules whole with a glass of water or juice. Don’t chew, break, crush or suck them as this could irritate your mouth or throat.</p>
  <p>If you have pain all the time, your doctor may recommend slow-release ibuprofen tablets or capsules. It’s usual to take these once a day in the evening or twice a day. Leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses if you are taking ibuprofen twice a day.</p>
  <p>For people who find it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, ibuprofen is available as a tablet that melts in your mouth, granules that you mix with a glass of water to make a drink  and as a syrup.</p>
  <h3>How much to use on your skin</h3>
  <p>The amount of ibuprofen you apply depends on the product you are using – check the package leaflet carefully for how much to apply.</p>
  <h3>How to apply ibuprofen to your skin</h3>
  <p>Ibuprofen also comes as a gel, mousse and spray that you rub into your skin.</p>
  <p>Gently massage the ibuprofen into the painful area 3 or 4 times a day. Leave at least 4 hours between applications, and don’t apply it more than 4 times in 24 hours.</p>
  <p>Never apply ibuprofen cream, gel or mousse  to your eyes, mouth, lips, nose or genital area or to inflamed or broken skin. Don’t put plasters or dressings over skin you have applied ibuprofen to.</p>
  <p>After applying ibuprofen to your skin, wash your hands, unless you are treating your hands.</p>
  <p>Some ibuprofen products are flammable. Don’t use them near burning cigarettes, flames, electric heaters or similar objects.</p>
  <h3>What if I forget to take or use it?</h3>
  <p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. In this case skip the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
  <p>Never take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
  <h3>What if I take or use too much?</h3>
  <p>Taking too much ibuprofen by mouth can be dangerous. It can cause side effects such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>feeling sick and vomiting</li>
    <li>tummy pain</li>
    <li>feeling tired or sleepy</li>
    <li>black poo and blood in your vomit - a sign of bleeding in your stomach</li>
    <li>tinnitus (ringing in your ears)</li>
    <li>difficulty breathing or changes in your heart rate (slower or faster)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you've taken more than the maximum dose of ibuprofen, go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible. Take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you.</p>
  <p>Applying too much ibuprofen to your skin is unlikely to cause problems, but watch out for the side effects mentioned above.</p>

      <p>Standard release tablets release gliclazide into your body quickly so you may need to take them several times a day depending on your dose.</p>
      <p>Extended release tablets dissolve slowly which means you don’t have to take them as regularly as the standard ones. One dose in the morning is usually enough.</p>
      <p>Your doctor or pharmacist will explain what type of gliclazide tablets you are on and how to take them.</p>
      <p>Swallow your gliclazide tablets whole with a glass of water, do not chew them.</p>
      <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
      <p>Your doctor will check your blood sugar levels regularly and may adjust your dose of gliclazide if necessary.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you miss a dose of gliclazide, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>
      <p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways that are suitable for you and your medicines.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>If you take too many gliclazide tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. An overdose of gliclazide can cause low blood sugar.</p>
      <p>If you think you have low blood sugar, have some food or drink that quickly gets sugar into your bloodstream such as sugar cubes or fruit juice. This type of sugar will not last long in your blood so you may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit. This will last longer.</p>
