  <p>Ibuprofen is not normally recommended in pregnancy, especially if you are 30 or more weeks pregnant. Research has shown it may cause birth defects affecting the heart or blood vessels.</p>
  <p>There may also be a link between taking ibuprofen in early pregnancy and miscarriage.</p>
  <p>Paracetamol is the best painkiller to take during pregnancy.</p>
  <p>Ibuprofen is safe to take by mouth or use on your skin if you are breastfeeding as only very small amounts get into breast milk.</p>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor if you plan to get pregnant or are already pregnant before taking ibuprofen.</span></p>
