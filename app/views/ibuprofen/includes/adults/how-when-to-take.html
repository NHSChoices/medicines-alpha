      <p>If you take ibuprofen 3 times a day, leave at least 6 hours between doses. If you take it 4 times a day, leave at least 4 hours between doses.</p>
      <p>Always take ibuprofen with food or a drink of milk to lessen the chance of an upset tummy.</p>
      <h3>How much to take by mouth</h3>
      <p>The dose of ibuprofen depends on the reason you are taking it, your age, if you have bought it or been prescribed it, if you have heart, kidney or liver problems, and how well it helps your symptoms.</p>
      <p>As a general rule when taking ibuprofen by mouth:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the usual dose is 200mg to 400mg 3 times a day</li>
        <li>your doctor may advise you to take a higher dose, up to 600mg 4 times a day. You should only take it 4 times a day if it is prescribed, not if you buy it</li>
        <li>doses are usually lower for elderly people and people with heart, kidney or liver problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The maximum dose of ibuprofen for an adult is 800mg per dose and 3200mg in 24 hours</p>
      <p>If you are taking slow-release tablets you will be on a higher dose than above. Take these as prescribed by your doctor.</p>
      <h3>How to take ibuprofen by mouth</h3>
      <p>Swallow ibuprofen tablets or capsules whole with a glass of water or juice. Don’t chew, break, crush or suck them as this could irritate your mouth or throat.</p>
      <p>If you have pain all the time, your doctor may recommend slow-release ibuprofen tablets or capsules. It’s usual to take these once a day in the evening or twice a day. Leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses if you are taking ibuprofen twice a day.</p>
      <p>For people who find it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, ibuprofen is available as a tablet that melts in your mouth, granules that you mix with a glass of water to make a drink and as a syrup.</p>
      <h3>How much to use on your skin</h3>
      <p>The amount of ibuprofen you apply depends on the product you are using – check the package leaflet carefully for how much to apply.</p>
      <h3>How to apply ibuprofen to your skin</h3>
      <p>Ibuprofen also comes as a gel, mousse and spray that you rub into your skin.</p>
      <p>Gently massage the ibuprofen into the painful area 3 or 4 times a day. Leave at least 4 hours between applications, and don’t apply it more than 4 times in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Never apply ibuprofen cream, gel or mousse to your eyes, mouth, lips, nose or genital area or to inflamed or broken skin. Don’t put plasters or dressings over skin you have applied ibuprofen to.</p>
      <p>After applying ibuprofen to your skin, wash your hands, unless you are treating your hands.</p>
      <p>Some ibuprofen products are flammable. Don’t use them near burning cigarettes, flames, electric heaters or similar objects.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take or use it?</h3>
      <p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. In this case skip the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
      <p>Never take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
      <h3>What if I take or use too much?</h3>
      <p>Taking too much ibuprofen by mouth can be dangerous. It can cause side effects such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>feeling sick and vomiting</li>
        <li>tummy pain</li>
        <li>feeling tired or sleepy</li>
        <li>black poo and blood in your vomit - a sign of bleeding in your stomach</li>
        <li>tinnitus (ringing in your ears)</li>
        <li>difficulty breathing or changes in your heart rate (slower or faster)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="emergencybanner">If you've taken more than the maximum dose of ibuprofen, go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible.</span></p>
      <p>Take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you.</p>
      <p>Applying too much ibuprofen to your skin is unlikely to cause problems, but watch out for the side effects mentioned above.</p>
