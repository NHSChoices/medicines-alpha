  <h3>What to do about:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>indigestion</strong> - stop taking ibuprofen and see your doctor as soon as possible. If you need something to ease the discomfort, try taking an <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antacid-medicines/Pages/Definition.aspx">antacid</a>, but don’t put off going to the doctor</li>
    <li><strong>feeling sick</strong> - it may help if you stick to simple meals and don’t eat rich or spicy food</li>
    <li><strong>diarrhoea and vomiting</strong> - have small, frequent sips of water. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions which you can buy from a pharmacy or supermarket to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx">dehydration</a>. Don’t take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea or vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor</li>
    <li><strong>constipation</strong> - if you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx">constipation</a>, eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to exercise more often, for example, by going for a daily walk or run</li>
    <li><strong>wind</strong> - try not to eat foods known to cause wind (like pulses, lentils, beans and onions). Eat smaller meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly. There are pharmacy medicines that can also help, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone</li>
    <li><strong>your skin being sensitive to sunlight</strong> - protect your skin where you have applied ibuprofen from strong sunlight. Do not use sun beds</li>
  </ul>
