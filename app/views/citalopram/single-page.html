      <p>Citalopram is a type of antidepressant known as an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).</p>
      <p>It is often used to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">depression</a> and also sometimes for <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Panic-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">panic attacks</a>.</p>
      <p>Citalopram helps many people recover from depression, and it has fewer unwanted effects than older antidepressants.</p>
      <p>Citalopram comes as tablets which are available only on prescription.</p>
      <p>It can be taken by children aged 12 and over.</p>
      <p>It is also called Cipramil.</p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul class="key-facts">
        <li>It usually takes four to six weeks for citalopram to work.</li>
        <li>Side effects, such as tiredness, dry mouth and sweating are common. They are usually mild and go away after a couple of weeks.</li>
        <li>Citalopram can affect an unborn baby. Tell your doctor straight away if you’re trying to get pregnant or become pregnant while taking it.</li>
        <li>Citalopram can cause withdrawal symptoms so don’t stop taking it without talking to your doctor.</li>
        <li>You can drink alcohol while taking citalopram.</li>
      </ul>



      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>Take citalopram once a day.</p>
      <p>The usual dose of citalopram is 20mg a day. The dose may be lower for children.</p>
      <p>You can choose to take citalopram at any time, as long as you stick to the same time every day. If you have trouble sleeping, it's best to take it in the morning.</p>
      <p>Citalopram doesn't upset the stomach so you can take it with or without food.</p>

          <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
          <p>The usual dose of citalopram is 20mg a day in adults. However, it may be started at a lower dose and may be increased to a maximum dose of 40mg a day.</p>
          <p>If you are over 65 or have liver problems the maximum recommended dose is 20mg a day.</p>
          <p>The usual dose of citalopram in children is 10mg a day but this may be increased to 40mg a day.</p>
          <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
          <p>If you forget to take a dose, don't worry. Take your next dose the next day at the usual time. Never take two doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>Ask your doctor for advice straight away as overdose can lead to potentially serious symptoms such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>vomiting</li>
            <li>tremor</li>

          <h3>Common side effects</h3>
          <p>Like all medicines, citalopram can cause side effects in some people but many people have no side effects or only minor ones.</p>
          <p>These very common side effects affect more than one in 10 people. Keep taking the medicine, but <strong>tell your doctor </strong>if they bother you or don't go away:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>dry mouth</li>
            <li>sweating a lot</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
          <p>It happens rarely (in fewer than one in 1,000 people), but some people may have serious side effects when taking citalopram.</p>
          <p>Tell a doctor straight away if you develop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>low sodium levels: warning signs include headache, trouble focusing, memory problems, not thinking clearly, weakness, seizures, or losing your balance</li>
            <li>thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life</li>

            <li>changes in your periods such as heavy bleeding, spotting, or bleeding between periods</li>
            <li>painful erections that last longer than four hours - this may happen even when you are not having sex</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Or, if you develop any signs of abnormal bleeding including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>bleeding from the gut: warning signs include vomiting blood or dark vomit; coughing up blood; blood in your urine; black or red poo</li>
            <li>bleeding from the gums or bruises that appear without a reason or that get bigger</li>
            <li>any bleeding that is very bad or that you cannot stop</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Serious allergic reaction</h3>

          <p><span class="alertbanner">It's rare to have an allergic reaction to citalopram but if this happens to you, stop taking the medicine and contact a doctor straight away.</span></p>

          <p>The warning signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">serious allergic reaction</a> are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>developing a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin</li>

          <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
          <p>Some of the common side effects of citalopram will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
          <h4>What to do about feeling sleepy</h4>
          <p>Cut down the amount of alcohol you drink.</p>
          <h4>What to do if you have a dry mouth</h4>
          <p>Chew sugar-free gum or sugar-free sweets.</p>
          <h4>What to do if you’re unable to sleep</h4>
          <p>Take citalopram first thing in the morning.</p>
          <h4>What to do if you feel anxious</h4>
          <p>Some people who take citalopram for panic attacks find their anxiety gets worse during the first few weeks of treatment. This usually wears off after a few weeks but speak to your doctor if it bothers you - a lower dose may help reduce your symptoms.</p>

          <p><span class="alertbanner">You can lessen the chance of having a side effect if you take citalopram in the evening so that you're asleep when the level of medicine in your body is highest.</span></p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="not-be-able">Who can take citalopram</h2>
      <p>Citalopram can be taken by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>children over the age of 12 (a lower dose will apply)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check with your doctor before starting to take citalopram if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have an allergy to citalopram or any of its ingredients</li>
        <li>have a heart problem as citalopram can speed up or change your heartbeat</li>
        <li>have ever taken any other medicines for depression. Some rarely used antidepressants can interact with citalopram to cause very high blood pressure even when they have been stopped for a few weeks</li>
        <li>are trying to become pregnant, are already pregnant or are breastfeeding. Citalopram is not recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding</li>
        <li>have an eye condition called glaucoma because citalopram can increase the pressure in your eye</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/Diabetes.aspx">diabetes</a> citalopram can make it more difficult to keep your blood sugar stable. Monitor your blood sugar more often for the first few weeks of treatment with citalopram and adjust your diabetes treatment if necessary.</p>

          <div id="more-1" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Citalopram is one of a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These medicines are thought to work by increasing the levels of a mood-enhancing chemical called serotonin in the brain.</p>

          </summary>
          <div id="more-6" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Antidepressants like citalopram help to jump start your mood so you feel better. You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you’re less anxious. You will hopefully take in your stride little things that used to worry you.</p>
            <p>Citalopram won’t change your personality or make you feel euphorically happy. It will simply help you feel like yourself again.</p>
            <p>Don’t expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.</p>

          <div id="more-2" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>You may not notice much improvement in your symptoms for a week or two until citalopram begins to take effect. It usually takes between four and six weeks before you will feel the full benefits.</p>
            <p>Don't stop taking citalopram after a week or two just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least six weeks to work.</p>

            <p>Once you are feeling better it is likely that you will continue to take citalopram for several more months to prevent the symptoms returning.</p>
            <p>You will need to discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of continuing to take citalopram for longer than a few months. The decision will depend on the type and severity of your initial symptoms, whether it's a one-off or recurring problem, how well citalopram works for you, and whether you have had any bothersome side effects.</p>

            <p>Citalopram isn't any better or worse than other antidepressants. However, sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than to another. Talk to your doctor if you aren’t feeling any better after six weeks.</p>

            <p>Antidepressants, including citalopram, are just one of several approaches to treating depression. Other potential treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)</li>
              <li>exercise programmes</li>
              <li>help to get a good night's sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on how long you have had depression, your symptoms, whether you have had any previous bouts of depression, whether previous treatment has worked, how likely you are to stick with your treatment, the potential side effects and your preferences and priorities.</p>
