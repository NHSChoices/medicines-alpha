      <h2>How to take citalopram</h2>
      <p>Citalopram should be taken once a day, at the same time every day with or without food.</p>
      <p>If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless itâ€™s close to the time for your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and go back to your normal time.</p>
      <p><em class="strong">Never take two doses at the same time or extra doses.</em></p>
      <p><em class="strong">Don't stop taking citalopram unless your doctor tells you to.</em></p>
      <p>If you stop taking citalopram suddenly you may get unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.</p>
      <p>Withdrawal symptoms are usually harmless and over within a few days but it's possible to prevent them by reducing the dose gradually when you stop taking this medicine.</p>
