          <p>You can drink alcohol with pregabalin but it may make you feel sleepy or make you lose your focus. During the first few days of taking pregabalin, it might be best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.</p>

        </summary>
        <div id="questions-2" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking pregabalin. This can also happen if your dose has increased. If this happens to you, don't drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.</p>
          <p>If you have epilepsy, you are not allowed to drive until you have had no seizures for 1 year, or if you only have seizures while you are asleep. You are also not supposed to drive if your epilepsy medicine has changed and for 6 months after.</p>

          <h3>Are there similar medicines to pregabalin?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-4" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Gabapentin (also called Neurontin) is a medicine that works in a similar way to pregabalin. Like pregabalin, it is taken to treat epilepsy and nerve pain. It is also be taken for migraines.</p>
          <p>However, there are other differences between pregabalin and gabapentin. Gabapentin is taken in different doses to pregabalin.</p>
          <p>If you need to change to gabapentin treatment, your doctor will explain how to safely swap from pregabalin.</p>

          <h3>Should I stick to the same brand of pregabalin?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-5" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Most people donâ€™t have to stay on the same brand of pregabalin as there is very little difference between brands. Talk to your doctor if you have been asked to switch to a different brand and you are worried about that.</p>
          <p>If you are taking pregabalin to treat epilepsy, your doctor may tell you to always take the same brand. For example, if you have not had a seizure in a long time and the brand is working well for you.</p>
