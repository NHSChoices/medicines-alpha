  <p>In general, paracetamol does not interfere with other medicines.</p>
  <p>It's important, though, that your child does not take another medicine with paracetamol in at the same time.</p>
  <p>Paracetamol isn't suitable for some children. Talk to your doctor if they take:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>warfarin (paracetamol can increase the risk of bleeding)</li>
    <li>medicine to treat epilepsy</li>
    <li>medicine to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tubercolosis/">tuberculosis (TB)</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking another medicine, including herbal remedies and supplements, before starting paracetamol.</span></p>
