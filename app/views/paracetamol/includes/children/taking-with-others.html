  <h3>Safe</h3>
  <p>The only safe painkiller to give to children alongside paracetamol is ibuprofen (Nurofen).</p>
  <p>If your child is very distressed, you can alternate a dose of paracetamol with a dose of ibuprofen every 2-3 hours.</p>
  <p>Avoid ibuprofen if your child has <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/pages/introduction.aspx">asthma</a>, unless advised otherwise by your GP.</p>
  <h3>Unsafe</h3>
  <p>Do not give your child another medicine with paracetamol in at the same time as you risk giving them too much.</p>
  <p>Paracetamol is an ingredient in lots of pain and common cold remedies including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lemsip</li>
    <li>Night Nurse</li>
    <li>Day and Night Nurse capsules</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Never give aspirin to a child under the age of 16.</p>
