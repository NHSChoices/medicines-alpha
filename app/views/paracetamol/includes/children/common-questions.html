          <p>Your child should start to feel less pain about 30 minutes after taking paracetamol tablets or syrup. It may take up to an hour for a suppository to work properly.</p>

        <div id="questions-2" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>If the paracetamol does not seem to be helping your childâ€™s pain, try alternating doses of paracetamol with doses of ibuprofen (Nurofen) at 2 to 3 hour intervals.</p>
          <p>Do not give extra doses of paracetamol. Do not give another medicine that contains paracetamol (such as Lemsip or Night Nurse) as you risk giving too much paracetamol.</p>
          <p>Do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16.</p>

          <h3>What if my child vomits?</h3>
        </summary>
        <div id="questions-3" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>If your child vomits less than 30 minutes after having a dose of paracetamol tablets or syrup, give them the same dose again.</p>
          <p>If your child vomits more than 30 minutes after a dose of tablets or syrup, you <strong>do not</strong> need to give them another dose. Wait until the next normal dose.</p>
          <p>If your child is finding it hard to keep tablets or syrup down, ask your doctor if paracetamol suppositories are an option. If they vomit straight after a suppository, you don't need to give them another dose as the suppository will still work.</p>
