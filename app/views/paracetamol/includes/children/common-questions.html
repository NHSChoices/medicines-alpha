          <p>Your child should start to feel less pain about 30 minutes after taking paracetamol tablets or syrup. It may take up to an hour for a suppository to work properly.</p>

          <p>If the paracetamol does not seem to be helping your childâ€™s pain, contact your pharmacist or doctor for advice. Do not give extra doses of paracetamol.</p>

          <p>If your child vomits less than 30 minutes after having a dose of paracetamol tablets or syrup, give them the same dose again.</p>
          <p>If your child is sick more than 30 minutes after taking a dose, you <strong>do not</strong> need to give them another dose. Wait until the next normal dose.</p>
          <p>If your child is sick at any time after a suppository, you do not need to give them another dose as the suppository will still work.</p>

          <p>Many medicines that you can buy for colds or pain contain paracetamol (this information is given on the label). Do not give these medicines to your child if you have already given them paracetamol, as you risk giving them too much.</p>
