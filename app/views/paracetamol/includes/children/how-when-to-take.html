  <p>Paracetamol tablets and syrup are available on prescription and to buy from shops and pharmacies.</p>
  <p>Paracetamol suppositories are available only on prescription.</p>

  <h3>When to give paracetamol</h3>
  <p>If your child needs help with pain day and night for several days, give a dose of paracetamol every 6 hours. This will help to relieve the pain safely without the risk of giving too much paracetamol.</p>
  <p>If your child has pain that comes and goes, give a dose of paracetamol when they first complain of pain. Wait at least 4 hours before giving another dose.</p>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">Wait at least 4 hours between doses of paracetamol. Do not give your child more than four doses of paracetamol in 24 hours.</span></p>

  <h3>How much paracetamol to give</h3>
  <p>Paracetamol tablets, syrup and suppositories come in a range of strengths. Children need to take a lower dose than adults, depending on their age.</p>
  <p>As a general rule, babies and children can have paracetamol syrup up to age 12 and beyond. While only children aged 6 and older can have tablets (soluble paracetamol tablets are only for children aged 12 and older).</p>
  <p>If you are not sure how much to give, ask your pharmacist or doctor.</p>

  <h3>How to give paracetamol to a child</h3>

  <h4>Tablets</h4>
  <p>Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, milk or juice. Tell your child not to chew the tablet.</p>
  <p>Calpol Fastmelts should not be swallowed - ask your child to let them dissolve on their tongue.</p>

  <h4>Syrup</h4>
  <p>Shake the bottle wall and measure out the right amount using a plastic syringe or spoon. These come in the medicine packet. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>
  <p>To hide the taste of liquid medicine, you can give the child a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after giving the medicine.</p>

  <h4>Suppositories</h4>
  <p>Paracetamol suppositories are small pellets of medicine which are inserted into the bottom. Follow the instructions on the leaflet inside the packet.</p>
  <h3>What if they take too much?</h3>
  <p>Giving your child too much paracetamol by accident can be dangerous. The effects of an overdose may not be obvious, but they can be serious and need treatment.</p>
  <p>If you think you may have given your child an extra dose of paracetamol by mistake, wait at least 8 hours before giving them any more.</p>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">If your child may have had more than a double dose of paracetamol, take them to hospital straight away.</span></p>
  <p>It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to hospital if you can.</p>
