      <h3>When to give paracetamol</h3>
      <p>If your child needs help with pain day and night for several days, give a dose of paracetamol every 6 hours. This will help to relieve the pain safely for a few days without the risk of giving too much paracetamol.</p>
      <p>If your child has pain that comes and goes, give a dose of paracetamol when they first complain of pain. Wait at least 4 hours before giving another dose.</p>
      <p>Do not give your child more than four doses of paracetamol in 24 hours. You may have to wait up to 6 hours between doses.</p>
      <h3>How much paracetamol to give</h3>
      <p>Paracetamol tablets, syrup and suppositories come in a range of strengths. Children need to take a lower dose than adults, depending on their age or weight.</p>
      <p>The dose will be shown on the medicine label if you have been given a prescription.</p>
      <p>If you have bought your medicine over the counter, follow the instructions on the bottle carefully.</p>
      <p>If you are not sure how much to give, ask your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
      <h3>How to give paracetamol to a child</h3>
      <h4>Tablets</h4>
      <p>Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water, milk or juice. Tell your child not to chew the tablet.</p>
      <h4>Syrup</h4>
      <p>Measure out the right amount using a plastic syringe or spoon. These come in the medicine packet. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>
      <p>To hide the taste of liquid medicine, you can give the child a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after giving the medicine.</p>
      <h4>Suppositories</h4>
      <p>Paracetamol suppositories are small, torpedo-shaped plugs of medicine which are inserted into the bottom. They are useful to relieve pain and fever in children who find it difficult to swallow tablets or syrup.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water before and after giving a suppository.</li>
        <li>Your child should be lying on their side or front.</li>
        <li>Hold one buttock gently to one side so that you can see the rectum.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the suppository and hold it with the rounded end close to the rectum.</li>
        <li>Use one finger to push the suppository gently into the rectum. It needs to go in by about 2 cm. You can use lubricating gel to make this more comfortable for your child. You can get this from a pharmacy.</li>
        <li>Your child should try to stay lying on their side for about 15 minutes. This will allow the suppository to spread further inside the bowel and make sure it doesn’t come out.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands again with soap and hot water.</li>
        <li>You can also put on disposable plastic gloves before using suppositories. However, some people find it easier to have bare, clean hands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your child does a poo within 30 minutes of inserting a suppository, you will need to insert another one.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>Giving your child too much paracetamol by accident can be dangerous. The effects of an overdose may not be obvious, but they can be serious and need treatment.</p>
      <p>If you think you may have given your child an extra dose of paracetamol by mistake, wait at least 8 hours before giving them any more.</p>
      <p><span class="alertbanner">If your child may have had more than a double dose of paracetamol, take them to hospital straight away.</span></p>
      <p> It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to hospital if you can.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to give it?</h3>
      <p>If your child is in pain, give the missed dose as soon as you remember. You must then wait at least 4 hours before giving the next dose.</p>
      <p>Never give your child a double doses of paracetamol to make up for a missed one.</p>
