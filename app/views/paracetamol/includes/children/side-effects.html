  <p>Paracetamol rarely causes side-effects if you give it at the right dosage</p>
  <p>Too much paracetamol can cause permanent damage to the liver. It is very important that you follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or on the medicine packet.</p>
  <p>If you are worried about a side effect or notice anything unusual, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
