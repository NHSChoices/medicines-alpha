  <p>Adults can take one or two 500mg tablets or capsules up to 4 times a day. Space out doses 4 to 6 hours apart.</p>
  <p>Overdosing on paracetamol can cause serious side effects. Don't be tempted to increase the dose, or take a double dose, if your pain is very bad.</p>
  <p>The total maximum dose of paracetamol for an adult is eight 500mg tablets or capsules a day.</p>
  <p>Children under 16 need to take a lower dose than adults, depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.</p>

      <p>Paracetamol can also be an ingredient in other medicines. Make sure you do not take any other medicines containing paracetamol at the same time.</p>
      <p>You may be advised to take lower doses of paracetamol if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have liver or kidney problems</li>
        <li>are very thin</li>
        <li>regularly drink more than the recommended amount of alcohol</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Advice for children</h3>
      <h4>Tablets</h4>
      <p>Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water, milk or juice. Your child should not chew the tablet.</p>
      <h4>Syrup</h4>
      <p>Measure out the right amount using a plastic syringe or spoon. These come in the medicine packet. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>
      <h4>Suppositories</h4>
      <p>Paracetamol suppositories are small, torpedo-shaped plugs of medicine which are inserted into the bottom. They are useful to relieve pain and fever in children who find it difficult to swallow tablets or syrup.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water before and after giving a suppository.</li>
        <li>Your child should be lying on their side or front.</li>
        <li>Hold one buttock gently to one side so that you can see the rectum.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the suppository and hold it with the rounded end close to the rectum.</li>
        <li>Use one finger to push the suppository gently into the rectum. It needs to go in by about 2cm. You can use lubricating gel to make this more comfortable for your child. You can get this from a pharmacy.</li>
        <li>Your child should try to stay lying on their side for about 15 minutes. This will allow the suppository to spread further inside the bowel and make sure it doesnâ€™t come out.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands again with soap and hot water.</li>
        <li>You can also put on disposable plastic gloves before using suppositories. However, some people find it easier to have bare, clean hands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your child does a poo within 30 minutes of inserting a suppository, you will need to insert another one.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>Taking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous and needs treatment.</p>
      <p>Taking 1 or 2 extra tablets by accident is unlikely to be harmful. If you have taken an extra dose or paracetamol, wait at least 8 hours before taking any more.</p>
      <p><span class="alertbanner">If you may have taken more than a double dose of paracetamol, go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible.</span></p>
      <p>Early symptoms of paracetamol overdose are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>nausea and vomiting (which usually settles within 24 hours)</li>
        <li>pain and tenderness on the right side below the ribs (which may not appear until 3 or 4 days after the overdose)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Often there are no obvious symptoms of an overdose. Go to A&amp;E even if you're feeling well. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&amp;E if you can.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you take paracetamol regularly and miss a dose take it as soon as you remember. If it's close to the time for your next dose when you remember, then skip the missed dose.</p>
      <p>Never take double doses of paracetamol. Never take extra doses to catch up.</p>
