      <h3>Other types of paracetamol</h3>
      <p>Paracetamol is widely available as tablets and capsules.</p>
      <p>For people who find it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, paracetamol is also available as soluble tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink and as a syrup.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>Taking one or two extra tablets by accident is unlikely to be harmful. If you have taken an extra dose of paracetamol, wait at least 8 hours before taking any more.</p>
      <p>Taking more than a double dose of paracetamol can be dangerous and may need treatment.</p>
      <p><span class="emergencybanner">If you may have taken more than a double dose of paracetamol, go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible.</span></p>
      <p>Early symptoms of paracetamol overdose are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>nausea and vomiting (which usually settles within 24 hours)</li>
        <li>pain and tenderness on the right side below the ribs (which may not appear until 3 or 4 days after the overdose)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Often there are no obvious symptoms of an overdose. Go to A&amp;E even if you're feeling well. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&amp;E if you can.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you take paracetamol regularly and miss a dose take it as soon as you remember. If it's close to the time for your next dose when you remember, then skip the missed dose.</p>
      <p>Never take double doses of paracetamol. Never take extra doses to catch up.</p>
      <p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways that are suitable for you and your medicines.</p>
