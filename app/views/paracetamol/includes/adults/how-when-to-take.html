      <p>Paracetamol can also be an ingredient in other medicines. Make sure you do not take any other medicines containing paracetamol at the same time.</p>
      <p>You may be advised to take lower doses of paracetamol if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have liver or kidney problems</li>
        <li>are very thin</li>
        <li>regularly drink more than the recommended amount of alcohol</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>Taking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous and needs treatment.</p>
      <p>Taking one or two extra tablets by accident is unlikely to be harmful. If you have taken an extra dose or paracetamol, wait at least 8 hours before taking any more.</p>
      <p><span class="alertbanner">If you may have taken more than a double dose of paracetamol, go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible.</span></p>
      <p>Early symptoms of paracetamol overdose are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>nausea and vomiting (which usually settles within 24 hours)</li>
        <li>pain and tenderness on the right side below the ribs (which may not appear until 3 or 4 days after the overdose)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Often there are no obvious symptoms of an overdose. Go to A&amp;E even if you're feeling well. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&amp;E if you can.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you take paracetamol regularly and miss a dose take it as soon as you remember. If it's close to the time for your next dose when you remember, then skip the missed dose.</p>
      <p>Never take double doses of paracetamol. Never take extra doses to catch up.</p>
