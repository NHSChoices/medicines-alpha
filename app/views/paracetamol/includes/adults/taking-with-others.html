  <h2 id="taking-with-others" class="content__h2">Taking paracetamol with other medicines</h2>
  <p>In general, paracetamol does not interfere with other medicines.</p>
  <p>It's important, though, that you do not take another medicine with paracetamol in at the same time because of the risk of overdosing on paracetamol.</p>
  <p>Paracetamol isn't suitable for some people. Talk to your doctor if you take:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>warfarin (paracetamol can increase the risk of bleeding)</li>
    <li>medicine to treat epilepsy</li>
    <li>medicine to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tubercolosis/">tuberculosis (TB)</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking a medicine, including ones you buy like herbal remedies and supplements, before taking paracetamol.</span></p>

      <h3>Other medicines containing paracetamol</h3>
      <p>It's safe to take paracetamol with most medicines including antibiotics.</p>
      <p>It's important, though, that you do not take another medicine with paracetamol in at the same time because of the risk of overdosing on paracetamol.</p>
      <p>Paracetamol is an ingredient in many pharmacy cold and flu remedies, such as Lemsip and Night Nurse.</p>
      <p>Paracetamol may also be combined with other painkillers which you may have been prescribed by your doctor such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>co-codamol (paracetamol and codeine)</li>
        <li>co-dydramol (paracetamol and dihydrocodeine)</li>
        <li>tramacet (paracetamol and tramadol)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="alertbanner">Before taking any other medicines, check the label to see whether they contain paracetamol.</span></p>
      <h3>Mixing paracetamol with herbal remedies and supplements</h3>
      <p>Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking the herbal medicine St John's Wort for <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="link__external">depression</a> as you may need to reduce your paracetamol dose.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, paracetamol is not generally affected by herbal remedies or supplements.</p>
