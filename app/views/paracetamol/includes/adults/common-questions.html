        <div id="questions-3" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Do not take paracetamol if you are also taking other medicines that contain paracetamol, such as codeine combinations, migraine preparations and some cough and cold remedies, because of the risk of overdosing on paracetamol. This may damage your liver and can be fatal.</p>
