        <h3>How isotretinoin works</h3>
      </summary>
      <div id="more-1" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Isotretinoin gel is intended for mild to moderate acne. This is acne that is mostly on the face with spots that are mainly whiteheads and blackheads.</p>
        <p>Isotretinoin capsules are only for severe acne. This is acne with lots of pus-filled spots that also affects the back and chest as well as the face.</p>
        <p>In both cases, isotretinoin treatment helps acne by reducing the amount of natural oil made by your skin so blocked pores are less likely. It also kills the bacteria that cause acne and relieves redness and soreness.</p>

        <h3>Other acne medicines</h3>
      </summary>
      <div id="more-3" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>There are a variety of acne treatments that offer an alternative to isotretinoin gel and capsules.</p>
        <p>For mild acne, there are a range of medicines that can be applied to your skin. These include other retinoid creams and gels or benzoyl peroxide cream or gel.</p>
        <p>If these don’t work your doctor may prescribe a cream or gel that contains an antibiotic plus a retinoid or benzoyl peroxide. They might also choose another gel called azelaic acid.</p>
        <p>For some women, taking the contraceptive pill may help their acne.</p>
        <p>For more severe acne, your doctor may try antibiotic tablets plus a gel or cream before you are referred to a specialist, or while you are waiting for an appointment with a specialist.</p>
        <p>Isotretinoin in the form of capsules is a powerful medicine generally reserved for people whose acne doesn't improve with other treatments. But there are other options for some people with severe acne, for example treatments that use lasers and other light devices and chemical peels.</p>

        <h3>Non-medical treatment options</h3>
      </summary>
      <div id="more-4" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>There are several lifestyle steps that can relieve acne:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try not to wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Too much washing can irritate your skin and make spots worse</li>
          <li>Wash spotty skin with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.</li>
          <li>Never ‘clean out’ blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scars.</li>
          <li>Don’t use too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as ‘non-comedogenic’ (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin).</li>
          <li>Remove make-up before going to bed.</li>
          <li>Use a fragrance-free, water-based moisturiser if dry skin is a problem</li>
          <li>Shower as soon as possible after exercising as sweat can irritate acne.</li>
          <li>Wash your hair regularly and try to stop letting your hair fall across your face.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you're a blood donor</h3>
      </summary>
      <div id="more-5" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>Don't donate blood while using isotretinoin and for at least one month after stopping. If your blood is given to a pregnant woman it may harm her unborn baby.</p>
