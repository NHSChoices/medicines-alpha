  <h3>Common side effects</h3>
  <p>The common side effects of isotretinoin capsules happen in around one in 10 people. They include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dry skin and lips – for safety, don’t have any waxing, dermabrasion or laser skin treatment while you are taking this medicine and for at least 6 months after you stop as this could cause scarring or skin irritation</li>
    <li>skin becoming more sensitive to sunlight – for safety, stay out of bright sun and use a high factor sun cream (SPF 15 or above) even on cloudy days. Do not use a sun-lamp or sun-beds</li>
