  <p>Isotretinoin is a strong medicine so it's important to take the capsules as instructed by your doctor.</p>
  <p>Usually, isotretinoin capsules are taken once or twice a day. Each capsule contains a dose of 10mg or 20mg of isotretinoin.</p>
  <p>Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water. Itâ€™s best to take them straight after a meal or snack to make sure they work properly.</p>

      <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
      <p>The dose of isotretinoin capsules varies from person to person and depends on your weight.</p>
      <p>As a general rule, the starting dose is 0.5 mg per kilogram body weight per day (0.5 mg/kg/day). So if you weigh 60 kg, your dose will usually start at 30 mg a day.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you take the capsules once a day and remember you have missed a dose on that day, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is the next day when you remember, skip the missed dose and have the next dose at the usual time.</p>
      <p>If you take the capsules twice a day and forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless this is within two hours of your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time.</p>
      <p>Never take a double dose or an extra dose to make up for a missed one.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>If you accidentally take too many isotretinoin capsules or someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact your pharmacist, NHS 111, your GP, or your nearest hospital immediately.</p>
      <h3>Will the amount I take go up or down?</h3>
      <p>After a few weeks your doctor may change your dose of capsules. For example, you may need a higher dose if your acne is not getting better. If you have any side effects that bother you, your doctor may lower your dose.</p>
