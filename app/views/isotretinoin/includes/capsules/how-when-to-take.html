  <p>Isotretinoin is a strong medicine so it's important to take the capsules as instructed by your doctor.</p>
  <p>As a general rule, the starting dose is 0.5mg per kilogram body weight per day (0.5 mg/kg/day). So if you weigh 60kg, your dose will usually start at 30mg a day.</p>
  <p>Usually, isotretinoin capsules are taken once or twice a day. Each capsule contains a dose of 10mg or 20mg of isotretinoin.</p>

      <p>The dose of isotretinoin capsules varies from person to person and depends on your weight.</p>
      <p>Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water. Itâ€™s best to take them straight after a meal or snack to make sure they work properly.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you take the capsules once a day and remember you have missed a dose on that day, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is the next day when you remember, skip the missed dose and have the next dose at the usual time.</p>
      <p>If you take the capsules twice a day and forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless this is within two hours of your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time.</p>
      <p>Never take a double dose. Never take an extra dose to make up for a missed one.</p>
      <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
      <p>If you take too many isotretinoin capsules by accident or someone else takes your medicine by accident, contact your pharmacist or doctor, call 111, or go to your nearest hospital immediately.</p>
      <h3>Will the amount I take go up or down?</h3>
      <p>After a few weeks your doctor may change your dose of capsules. You may need a higher dose if your acne is not getting better. You may need a lower dose if you have side effects that bother you.</p>
