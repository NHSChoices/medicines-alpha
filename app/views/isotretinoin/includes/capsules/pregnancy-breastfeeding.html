<p>This medicine is likely to harm a baby. It also increases the risk of miscarriage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not take isotretinoin capsules if you think you are pregnant, you are pregnant, or if you are breastfeeding.</li>
  <li>If you become pregnant during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, stop taking the capsules and tell your doctor as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>It's very important that you don't get pregnant while you are taking isotretinoin capsules. You will be asked by your doctor to follow strict rules to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for one month afterwards.</li>

    <p>Before starting treatment with isotretinoin capsules, women who are able to become pregnant must agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>use at least 1, and ideally 2, reliable methods of contraception for 1 month before starting isotretinoin capsules and for 1 month after treatment has stopped. The second contraceptive should be a barrier method of contraception (for example a condom) although you should not use barrier methods on their own.</li>
      <li>have a pregnancy test before, during and 5 weeks after the end of treatment. Some doctors may ask you to agree to have monthly pregnancy tests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Men and isotretinoin capsules</h3>
    <p>Men can safely take isotretinoin capsules if they and their partner are trying for a baby.</p>
    <p>Isotretinoin capsules do not seem to damage sperm. Only tiny amounts of isotretinoin get into semen, which is too little to harm the unborn baby of your partner.</p>
