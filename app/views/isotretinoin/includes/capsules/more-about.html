      <h3>How isotretinoin capsules works</h3>
    </summary>
    <div id="more-1" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>Isotretinoin capsules are only for severe acne. This is acne with lots of pus-filled spots that also affects the back and chest as well as the face.</p>
      <p>Isotretinoin capsules help severe acne by reducing the amount of natural oil made by your skin so blocked pores are less likely. The medicine also kills the bacteria that cause acne and relieves redness and soreness.</p>

      <p>Isotretinoin in the form of capsules is a powerful medicine generally reserved for people whose acne doesn't improve with other treatments.</p>
      <p>But there are other options for some people with severe acne, for example treatments that use lasers and other light devices and chemical peels.</p>

      <h3>Self-help remedies</h3>
    </summary>
    <div id="more-4" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>There are several lifestyle steps that can relieve even severe acne:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try not to wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Too much washing can irritate your skin and make spots worse</li>
        <li>Wash spotty skin with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.</li>
        <li>Never ‘clean out’ blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scars.</li>
        <li>Don’t use too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as ‘non-comedogenic’ (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin).</li>
        <li>Remove make-up before going to bed.</li>
        <li>Use a fragrance-free, water-based moisturiser if dry skin is a problem</li>
        <li>Shower as soon as possible after exercising as sweat can irritate acne.</li>
        <li>Wash your hair regularly and try to stop letting your hair fall across your face.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If you're a blood donor</h3>
    </summary>
    <div id="more-5" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>Don't donate blood while taking isotretinoin capsules and for at least one month after stopping. If your blood is given to a pregnant woman it may harm her unborn baby.</p>
