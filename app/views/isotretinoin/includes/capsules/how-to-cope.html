<h3>What to do about dry skin or lips</h3>
<p>Apply a moisturiser and lip balm regularly. The best type of moisturiser is an oil-free face moisturiser for sensitive skin. Try and keep your showers shorter than 2 minutes and use lukewarm water rather than hot.</p>
<h3>What to do about dry eyes</h3>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or optician to recommend some eye drops. If you wear contact lenses and these become uncomfortable, you might have to wear glasses instead while you are taking this medicine.</p>
<h3>What to do about dry mouth</h3>
<p> Try chewing sugar free gum or sweets</p>
<h3>What to do about dry nose and nosebleeds</h3>
<p>Try applying a thin layer of Vaseline to the inside edges of your nose.</p>
<h3>What to do about headache, joint, muscle and back pain</h3>
<p>Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Light exercise should not be a problem but try to avoid heavy exercise because it may make joint or muscle pain worse.</p>
