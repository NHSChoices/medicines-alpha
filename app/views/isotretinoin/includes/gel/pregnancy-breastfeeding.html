  <p>Don’t use isotretinoin gel if you are pregnant because this medicine can harm a baby.</p>
  <p>If you become pregnant during treatment with isotretinoin gel, stop using it and tell to your doctor as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>To prevent pregnancy while you take isotretinoin gel, it’s recommended that you use at least one - ideally two - types of contraception for one month before treatment begins, during treatment and for one month after treatment has finished.</p>
  <p>It’s unlikely that isotretinoin gel could harm your baby through breastfeeding, but there is not enough information to say for certain that is safe. Discuss with your doctor whether you should use isotretinoin gel if you are breastfeeding.</p>
