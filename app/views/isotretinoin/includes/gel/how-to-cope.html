  <h3>What to do about dry skin or lips</h3>
  <p> Apply a moisturiser and lip balm regularly. The best type of moisturiser is an oil-free face moisturiser for sensitive skin. Try and keep your showers shorter than 2 minutes and use lukewarm water rather than hot.</p>
  <h3>What to do about skin irritation or pain</h3>
  <p>Try using the gel less often, maybe once a day instead of twice, or every other day. Or you could stop using the gel for a few days until the irritation goes away and then try using it again. If the irritation does not go away, stop using the gel and speak to your doctor.</p>
  <p><span class="infobanner">You can <a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">report any suspected side effect</a> to a UK safety scheme.</span></p>
