  <p>Apply isotretinoin gel once or twice a day as instructed by your doctor.</p>
  <p>Put a thin layer of the gel on affected skin using your fingertips and smooth it in. Apply it to all areas of skin which have acne and not just each spot.</p>
  <p>Always wash and dry your skin and completely remove any make-up before applying the gel. This will help it work better. Wash your hands before and after using the gel.</p>

      <p>Do not apply isotretinoin gel to irritated areas of skin, for example cuts, burns or sunburn, as it can make the irritation worse. Only ever use isotretinoin gel on your skin and keep it away from your mouth, lips and eyes.</p>
      <p>Isotretinoin gel is flammable so keep it away from fire.</p>
      <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
      <p>Use the amount of isotretinoin gel that your doctor has recommended.</p>
      <p>Apply only a thin layer of gel to affected skin. Take care not to use too much especially where the gel could run into your eyes or build up in folds of skin. Using more gel will not make your spots clear up more quickly.</p>
      <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
      <p>If you forget to apply the gel, skip the missed dose and apply the next dose at the usual time. Do not apply a double dose or an extra dose to make up for a missed one.</p>
      <h3>What if I use too much?</h3>
      <p>If you use too much isotretinoin gel, or use it more often than you should, it may make you skin red or irritated. If this happens, use the gel less often or stop using it for a few days.</p>
      <h3>Will the amount I take go up or down?</h3>
      <p>The dose of isotretinoin gel will probably not change, although if your skin becomes irritated, your doctor may suggest that you use it less often for a while.</p>
