        <ul>

        <h3>Other acne medicines</h3>
      </summary>
      <div id="more-3" aria-hidden="true">
        <p>For mild acne, there are a range of medicines that you can rub-on your skin. These include other retinoid creams and gels, or benzoyl peroxide cream or gel.</p>
        <p>If these don’t work your doctor may prescribe a cream or gel that contains an antibiotic plus a retinoid or benzoyl peroxide. They might also choose another type of gel called azelaic acid.</p>
        <p>For some women, taking the contraceptive pill helps their acne.</p>
        <p>For more severe acne, your doctor may prescribe antibiotic tablets plus a gel or cream before you are referred to a hospital specialist, or while you are waiting for an appointment with a hospital specialist.</p>
        <p>It can take 2 to 3 months for many of these treatments to work.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Try not to wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Too much washing can irritate your skin and make spots worse.</li>
          <li>Wash spotty skin with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.</li>
          <li>Never ‘clean out’ blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scars.</li>
          <li>Don’t use too much make-up and cosmetics.</li>
          <li>Use water-based make-up and toiletries that are described as ‘non-comedogenic’ (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin).</li>
          <li>Remove make-up before going to bed.</li>
          <li>Use a fragrance-free, water-based moisturiser if dry skin is a problem.</li>
          <li>Shower as soon as possible after exercising as sweat can irritate acne.</li>
          <li>Wash your hair regularly and try to stop letting your hair fall across your face.</li>
        </ul>
