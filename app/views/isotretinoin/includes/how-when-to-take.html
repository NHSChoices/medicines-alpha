  <h2 id="how-when" class="content__h2" >How and when to take</h2>
  <h3>Capsules</h3>
  <p>Capsules are usually taken once or twice a day.</p>
  <p>Each capsule contains a dose of 10mg or 20mg of isotretinoin.</p>
  <p>Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water. Itâ€™s best to take them straight after a meal or snack to make sure they work properly.</p>
  <h3>Gel</h3>
  <p>Isotretinoin gel is usually applied once or twice a day as instructed by your doctor.</p>
  <p>Put a thin layer of isotretinoin gel on affected skin using your fingertips and smooth it in. Apply it to all areas of skin which have acne and not just each spot.</p>
  <p>Always wash and dry your skin and completely remove any make-up before applying the gel. This will help it work better. Wash your hands before and after using the gel.</p>

      <p>Do not apply <strong>isotretinoin gel</strong> to irritated areas of skin, for example cuts, burns or <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sunburn/Pages/Introduction.aspx">sunburn</a>, as it can make the irritation worse. Only ever use isotretinoin gel on your skin and keep it away from your mouth, lips and eyes.</p>
      <p><strong>Isotretinoin gel</strong> is flammable so keep it away from fire.</p>
      <h3><strong>How much will I take?</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Capsules:</strong> The dose of isotretinoin capsules varies from person to person and depends on your weight.</p>
      <p>As a general rule, the starting dose is 0.5 mg per kilogram body weight per day (0.5 mg/kg/day). So if you weigh 60 kg, your dose will usually start at 30 mg a day.</p>
      <p><strong>Gel:</strong> Apply only a thin layer of isotretinoin gel to skin that is affected by acne. Take care not to use too much gel especially where it could run into your eyes or build up in folds of skin. Using more gel will not make your spots clear up more quickly.</p>
      <h3><strong>What if I forget to take it?</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Capsules:</strong> If you take the capsules once a day and remember you have missed a dose on that day, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is the next day when you remember, skip the missed dose and have the next dose at the usual time.</p>
      <p>If you take the capsules twice a day and forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless this is within two hours of your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time.</p>
      <p>Never take a double dose or an extra dose to make up for a missed one.</p>
      <p><strong>Gel:</strong> If you forget to apply the gel, skip the missed dose and apply the next dose at the usual time. Do not apply a double dose or an extra dose to make up for a missed one.</p>
      <h3><strong>What if I take too much?</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Capsules:</strong> If you accidentally take too many isotretinoin capsules or someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact your pharmacist, NHS 111, your GP, or your nearest hospital immediately.</p>
      <p><strong>Gel:</strong> If you use too much isotretinoin gel, or use it more often than you should, it may make you skin red or irritated. If this happens, use the gel less often or stop using it for a few days.</p>
      <h3><strong>Will the amount I take go up or down?</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Capsules:</strong> After a few weeks your doctor may change your dose of capsules. For example, you may need a higher dose if your acne is not getting better. If you have any side effects your doctor may lower your dose.</p>
      <p><strong>Gel:</strong> The dose of isotretinoin gel should not change, although if your skin becomes irritated, your doctor may suggest that you use it less often for a while.</p>
