  <p>There aren’t usually any problems with mixing gabapentin with other medicines.</p>
  <p>You can safely use any type of contraception, including contraceptive pills, alongside gabapentin.</p>
  <p>Some indigestion remedies, called antacids, reduce the amount of gabapentin that the body takes in so it doesn’t work as well. To prevent this, take an antacid at least 2 hours before or after your dose of gabapentin.</p>
  <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you’re taking any other medicines, including herbal remedies and supplements, before starting gabapentin.</span></p>
