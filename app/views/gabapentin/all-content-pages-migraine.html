      <h1 class="content__h2 u-marginbottom20">Gabapentin for migraine</h1>

      <p>Gabapentin is a type of painkiller that is sometimes used to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/migraine/Pages/Introduction.aspx">migraine headaches</a>.</p>
      <p>Gabapentin is usually only taken by adults.</p>
      <p>It is available only on prescription as capsules, tablets and as a liquid that you swallow.</p>
      <p>The medicine is also called by various brand names, including Neurontin.</p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gabapentin is usually taken three times a day. You can take it with or without food.</li>
        <li>Gabapentin can cause withdrawal problems. Don’t stop the medicine suddenly unless your doctor asks you to.</li>
        <li>The most common side effects of gabapentin are feeling sleepy, tiredness and dizziness.</li>
        <li>You can drink alcohol while taking gabapentin, but it may make you feel sleepy or tired.</li>
      </ul>

        <p class="disclaimer__info-text">Check the leaflet inside your medicine packet for specific information about the brand that you are taking.</p>
      </div>


      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>Most people need to take gabapentin three times a day.</p>
      <p>Try to space your doses evenly through the day. For example, first thing in the morning, early afternoon and at bedtime.</p>
      <p>Gabapentin doesn’t upset the stomach so you can take it with or without food, but it’s best to be consistent day after day.</p>

      <details role="group">
        <summary class="more-info" role="button" aria-controls="details-content-1" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="true">
          <span>More information</span>
        </summary>
        <div id="details-content-1" aria-hidden="false">
          <p>To avoid unwanted side effects, your doctor will prescribe a low dose to start with and then increase it over a few days.</p>
          <p>Swallow gabapentin capsules and tablets with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.</p>
          <p>Gabapentin tablets and capsules come in different strengths. Depending on your dose, you may need to split the tablets in half.</p>
          <p>If you break a tablet and take only half of it, take the other half at your next dose. Always use a broken tablet as soon as possible, or within a few days. Never chew a broken tablet.</p>
          <p>Only ever break tablets in half – capsules need to be swallowed whole.</p>
          <p>Gabapentin is also available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets.</p>
          <p>If you are taking gabapentin as a liquid, it will come with a dose-measuring plastic syringe or spoon to help you take the right amount.  If you don’t have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p>

          <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
          <p>The usual dose to prevent migraines varies but can be up to 2,400mg a day.</p>

          <h3>How long will I take it for?</h3>
          <p>It is likely that once your migraines have gone you will continue to take gabapentin for several months to stop them coming back.</p>

          <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
          <p>If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is within two hours of the next dose, it is better to leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
          <p>Never take two doses at the same time or an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>

          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>Accidentally taking an extra dose of gabapentin may cause unpleasant side effects. These include feeling dizzy or sleepy, seeing double, slurring your words, diarrhoea and passing out.</p>
          <p>If this happens, call your doctor or NHS 111 straight away, or go to the nearest hospital accident and emergency department.</p>
          <p>Take with you any gabapentin that you have left, and the labelled container so the hospital can see what you have taken.</p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>
      <p>Most people who take gabapentin don’t have too much trouble with side effects. The most common ones are feeling sleepy, tiredness and dizziness. These tend to pass within a week or two as your body gets used to gabapentin.</p>

        </summary>
        <div id="details-content-3" aria-hidden="false">
          <h3>Common side effects</h3>
          <p>These very common side effects may happen in more than one in 10 people. They are usually mild and go away by themselves. Keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother you or don't go away:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>feeling sleepy, tired or dizzy</li>
          <li>losing your coordination</li>
          <li>feeling sick and vomiting</li>
          <li>wind, diarrhoea and constipation (can’t poo)</li>
          <li>indigestion</li>
          <li>dry mouth</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may find you put on weight because gabapentin can make you feel hungry.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the medicine can cause memory problems, mood changes, swollen arms and legs, blurred vision and, for men, difficulties with getting an erection.</p>

          <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
          <p>Very few people taking gabapentin have serious problems. It seems to be a very safe medicine.</p>
          <p>Tell a doctor straight away if you notice a serious side effect. These are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people taking gabapentin have had suicidal thoughts, and they can happen after only a week of treatment</li>
          <li>yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes. These may be warning signs of <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Jaundice/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Jaundice">jaundice</a></li>
          <li>unusual bruises or bleeding. These may be warning signs of a blood disorder</li>
          <li>long-lasting stomach pain, feeling sick or being sick. These may be warning signs of an <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Pancreatitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Pancreatitis">inflamed pancreas</a></li>
          <li>muscle pain or weakness and you are on <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Dialysis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">haemodialysis</a> because of <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Kidney-disease-chronic/Pages/Introduction.aspx">kidney failure</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Serious allergic reaction</h3>
          <p><span class="alertbanner"><strong>It's extremely rare to have an allergic reaction to gabapentin but if this happens to you, stop taking the medicine and tell a doctor straight away.</strong></span></p>

          <p>The warning signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Serious allergic reaction">serious allergic reaction</a> are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>an itchy red rash</li>

          <li>tightness in the chest or throat</li>
          <li>having trouble breathing or talking</li>
          <li>swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Serious allergic reaction is a medical emergency. Contact a doctor straight away if you think you or someone around you is having a serious allergic reaction.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>How to cope with side effects</h3>
          <h4>What to do about feeling sleepy, tired or dizzy</h4>
          <p>Don’t drive or use tools or machinery if you are feeling this way.
          <p>As your body gets used to gabapentin, these side effects should wear off.
          <p>If they don’t wear off within a week or two,  your doctor may reduce your dose or increase it more slowly.  If that doesn’t work you may need to switch to a different medicine.

          <h4>What to do about feeling sick</h4>
          <p>Take gabapentin with or after a meal or snack to ease feelings of sickness. It may also help if you don’t eat rich or spicy food while you're taking this medicine.</p>
          <h4>What to do about diarrhoea and vomiting</h4>
          <p>Have small but frequent sips of water if you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diarrhoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a> or you are vomiting. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions which you can buy from a pharmacy or supermarket to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Dehydration">dehydration</a>.</p>
          <p>Don’t take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea or vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.</p>
          <h4>What to do about constipation</h4>
          <p>If you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx" title="Constipation">constipation</a>, eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and try to drink several glasses of water or other fluid each day. It may also help to exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run.</p>
          <h4>What to do about weight gain</h4>
          <p>Gabapentin can make you hungrier so it can be quite a challenge to stop yourself putting on weight.</p>
          <p>Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes. Don’t snack on foods that contain a lot of calories, such as crisps, cakes, biscuits and sweets.</p>
          <p>If you feel hungry between meals, eat fruit and vegetables and low-calorie foods.</p>
          <p>Regular exercise will also help to keep your weight stable.</p>
          <h4>What to do about a dry mouth</h4>
          <p>Try chewing sugar-free gum or sucking sugar-free sweets.</p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="taking-with-others">Taking gabapentin with other medicines</h2>
      <p>There aren’t usually any problems with mixing gabapentin with other medicines.</p>
<p>Gabapentin does not change the way other medicines work. And there are very few medicines that change the way gabapentin works.</p>
<p>Some indigestion remedies, called antacids, reduce the amount of gabapentin that the body takes in so it doesn’t work as well. This problem can be prevented if you take an antacid at least 2 hours before or after your dose of gabapentin.</p>

<p><span class="alertbanner"><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you’re taking any other prescription medicines or a medicine you buy including herbal remedies and supplements before starting gabapentin.</strong></span></p>

<p>Women who are trying to get pregnant or have become pregnant are routinely recommended to take at least 400mcg of a vitamin called folic acid everyday. It helps the unborn baby grow normally.</p>
<p>Gabapentin has been linked with low folic acid levels. So, if you take gabapentin, your doctor will prescribe a high dose of folic acid (5mg a day) for you to take during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you take gabapentin around the time of giving birth, your baby may need extra monitoring for a few days after they’re born because they may have gabapentin withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<h3>Gabapentin and breastfeeding</h3>

<p>Do not stop taking gabapentin suddenly even if you feel fine. Gabapentin can build up in the body so that if you stop taking it suddenly you may have a severe withdrawal syndrome with unpleasant symptoms that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>difficulty sleeping</li>
<li>feeling sick</li>
<li>pain</li>
<li>sweating</li>
</ul>
<p>It's possible to prevent withdrawal symptoms by reducing the dose bit by bit.</p>

            <p>Gabapentin can make you feel relaxed, calm and 'high'. It can also intensify the 'highs' of street drugs like cannabis and heroin. So, if you use street drugs alongside gabapentin, there may be more chance of unpleasant side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.</p>
