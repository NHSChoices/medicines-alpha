      <p>Lansoprazole is a type of medicine known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach makes.</p>
      <p>It’s widely used to treat stomach acid problems such as <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Indigestion/Pages/Introduction.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">indigestion</span></a>, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx">heartburn</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx">acid reflux</a>. Lansoprazole is also taken to prevent and treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Peptic-ulcer/Pages/Introduction.aspx">stomach ulcers</a>.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, lansoprazole is taken for a rare illness caused by a tumour in the pancreas or gut called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.</p>
      <p>Lansoprazole is available only on prescription as capsules, tablets and as a liquid that you swallow.</p>
      <p>It’s also called by the brand name Zoton FasTabs.</p>
      <p>Children can take lansoprazole if it’s been prescribed by a doctor.</p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul class="key-facts">
        <li>It’s usual to take lansoprazole once a day in the morning.</li>
        <li>For severe illness, you can take it twice a day - in the morning and in the evening.</li>
        <li>Common side effects include headache, diarrhoea and stomach pain. These tend to be mild and go away when you stop taking the medicine.</li>
        <li>You can drink alcohol while taking lansoprazole, but be aware that alcohol can make your digestive symptoms worse.</li>
        <li>If you’re self-treating with lansoprazole, don’t take it for longer than two weeks without checking with a doctor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>It's usual to take lansoprazole once a day, first thing in the morning.</p>
      <p>If you take lansoprazole twice a day, take one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening.</p>
      <p>Lansoprazole works best if you take it 30 minutes before a meal or snack. That's because food slows down lansoprazole getting into your system.</p>

        <div id="details-content-1" aria-hidden="false">
          <h3>Tablets and capsules</h3>
          <p>Swallow tablets and capsules whole with a glass of water or juice.</p>
          <p>If you have problems swallowing capsules, you can open lansoprazole capsules and mix the granules inside with a little water or fruit juice, or sprinkle them onto soft food, such as yogurt or apple puree, to help you swallow them.</p>
          <p>Lansoprazole also comes as a 'dispersible' tablet that melts in your mouth.</p>
          <h3>Liquid medicine</h3>
          <p>Lansoprazole is available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow capsules or tablets.</p>
          <p>If you or your child are taking lansoprazole as a liquid, the medicine will come with a dose-measuring plastic syringe or spoon to help you take the right amount. If you don’t have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p>
          <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
          <p>Each tablet or capsule contains 15mg or 30mg of lansoprazole.</p>
          <p>Your dose of lansoprazole depends on the reason why you are taking it, your age, how well your liver works and how well it helps your symptoms.</p>
          <p>As a general rule the usual dose to treat:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>indigestion is 15mg to 30mg a day</li>
          <li>acid reflux disease is 15mg to 30mg a day</li>
          <li>or prevent stomach ulcers is 15mg to 30mg a day</li>
          <li>Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is 60mg a day. This can increase to 120mg a day depending on how well it works for you</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Doses are usually lower for children, elderly people and people with liver problems.</p>
          <p>For babies and children, the doctor will use your child’s weight to work out the right amount.</p>
          <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
          <p>Sometimes your doctor will increase your dose of lansoprazole if it isn’t working well enough.</p>
          <p>Depending on the reason you take lansoprazole, you may take a higher dose to begin with, usually for a month or two. After this, your doctor may recommend that you take a lower dose.</p>
          <h3>How long will I take it for?</h3>
          <p>Depending on your illness or the reason you are taking lansoprazole, you may only take it for a few weeks or months. Sometimes you might need to take it for longer, even many years.</p>
          <p>Some people don’t need to take lansoprazole every day and take it only when they have symptoms. Once you feel better (often after a few days or weeks), you can stop taking it. Taking lansoprazole in this way is not suitable for everyone as it depends on your illness. Discuss with your doctor what is best for you.</p>
          <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
          <p>If you usually take it once a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is within 12 hours of your next dose in which case skip the missed dose.</p>
          <p>If you usually take it twice a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is within four hours of your next dose in which case skip the missed dose.</p>
          <p>Don't take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>
          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>Accidentally taking too much lansoprazole may cause side effects such as flushed skin, feeling sweaty, a fast heartbeat, feeling sleepy, blurred vision and feeling confused or agitated.  </p>
          <p>If this happens, call your doctor straight away, or go to the nearest hospital accident and emergency department.</p>
          <p>Take with you any lansoprazole that you have left, and the medicine packet so the hospital can see what you have taken.</p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>
      <p>Most people who take lansoprazole do not have any side effects. If you do get a side effect, it is usually mild and will go away when you stop taking lansoprazole.</p>
      <p>The most common side effects of lansoprazole include headache, diarrhoea and stomach pain.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>joint pain along with a red skin rash, especially in parts of your body exposed to the sun, such as your arms, cheeks and nose. These can be signs of a rare condition called subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus that can happen weeks even years after taking lansoprazole.</li>
          <li>stomach pain that seems to be getting worse. This could be a sign of an inflamed liver or pancreas. It happens in fewer than one in 1,000 people taking lansoprazole.</li>
          <li>reddening, blisters and peeling of the skin. There may also be severe blisters and bleeding in the lips, eyes, mouth, nose and genitals.

          <h3>How to cope with side effects</h3>
          <h4>What to do about feeling sick</h4>
          <p>Try taking lansoprazole with or after a meal or snack to see if that helps to ease feelings of sickness. It may also help if you don’t eat rich or spicy food while you're taking this medicine.</p>
          <h4>What to do about diarrhoea and vomiting</h4>
          <p>Drink plenty of water if you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diarrhoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx">diarrhoea</a> or you are being sick – have small, frequent sips. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions which you can buy from a pharmacy or supermarket to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx">dehydration</a>.</p>
          <p>Don’t take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea or vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor. </p>
          <h4>What to do about constipation</h4>
          <p>If you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx">constipation</a>, eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Also exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
          <h4>What to do about wind</h4>
          <p>Don’t eat foods known to cause wind (like pulses, lentils, beans and onions).</p>
          <p>It might also help to eat smaller and more frequent meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly.</p>
          <p>There are also some pharmacy remedies that can help, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone.</p>

              <p>Yes, you can drink alcohol with lansoprazole. However, drinking alcohol makes your stomach produce more acid than normal. This can irritate your stomach lining and make your symptoms worse.</p>

              <p>There are four other medicines that are similar to lansoprazole. They are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>omeprazole</li>
              <li>esomeprazole</li>

              <li>rabeprazole</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Like lansoprazole, these medicines are proton pump inhibitors. They work in the same way as lansoprazole to reduce acid in your stomach. They generally work as well as and have similar side effects to lansoprazole. However, they may be given in different doses to lansoprazole.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, if lansoprazole does not work or agree with you, your GP may suggest that you try taking another proton pump inhibitor.</p>
              <p>Lansoprazole is only available on prescription but you can buy omeprazole, esomeprazole and pantoprazole directly from pharmacies. You can also buy esomeprazole from supermarkets.</p>

            </summary>
            <div id="questions-8" aria-hidden="true">
              <p>There are a variety of other pharmacy and prescription medicines for indigestion and heartburn.</p>
              <p><strong>Antacids</strong>, like calcium carbonate (Tums), sodium bicarbonate (Alka Seltzer) Maalox and Milk of Magnesia, relieve indigestion and heartburn by neutralising the acid in your stomach. They give quick relief that lasts for a few hours. They’re ideal for occasional bouts of stomach acid symptoms.</p>
              <p>Some antacids, such as Gaviscon, have an extra ingredient called alginic acid. They work by lining your stomach so that juices from it don’t splash up into your foodpipe. They’re especially good for relieving acid reflux.</p>
              <p>Antacids are available from pharmacies and supermarkets.</p>
              <p><strong>Histamine antagonists</strong> (commonly called H2 blockers) reduce the amount of acid made in your stomach, but they do this in a different way to PPIs.</p>
              <p>They include ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid) and nizatidine (Axid).</p>
              <p>In general, proton pump inhibitors like lansoprazole are used first because they are better than H2 blockers at reducing stomach acid. However, if you don't get on with a proton pump inhibitor (for example, because of side effects), your doctor may prescribe an H2 blocker.</p>
              <p>You can buy famotidine and ranitidine over the counter from pharmacies.</p>

          <div id="more-1" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Lansoprazole is a type of medicine called a proton pump inhibitor. Proton pumps are found on cells lining the stomach. They are used by these cells to make stomach acid. Lansoprazole prevents proton pumps from working properly. This reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes.</p>

          </summary>
          <div id="more-2" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>There are some serious side effects that are more likely to happen if you take lansoprazole for more than a year. These side effects are more likely the longer you take lansoprazole. They include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>bone fractures</li>
            <li>gastrointestinal infections </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anaemia-vitamin-B12-and-folate-deficiency/Pages/Introduction.aspx">vitamin B12 deficiency</a>. Symptoms include feeling very tired, a sore and red tongue, mouth ulcers and pins and needles</li>
            <li>low levels of magnesium in your blood. This is more likely if you take lansoprazole for more than three months. Low magnesium can make you feel tired, confused, dizzy and cause muscle twitches, tremors and an irregular heartbeat</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To reduce the chance of getting these side effects, your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose of lansoprazole needed to ease your symptoms for the shortest length of time.</p>
            <p>If you take lansoprazole for a long time, your doctor will regularly check if you still need it.</p>
            <p>It's not known if lansoprazole works less well the longer you take it. If you feel like lansoprazole is not working any longer, talk to your doctor.</p>
