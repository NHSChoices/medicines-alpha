      <p>Sertraline is a type of antidepressant that is often used to treat depression, and also sometimes panic attacks or obsessive compulsive disorder. </p>
      <p>Sertraline helps many people recover from depression, and it has fewer unwanted effects than older antidepressants. </p>
      <p>It is also called Lustral. </p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It usually takes 4-6 weeks to feel the full benefits of sertraline. </li>
        <li>Side effects such as feeling sick, headache and trouble sleeping are common, but tend to be mild and pass after a couple of weeks.</li>
        <li>Sertraline can affect an unborn baby. Tell your doctor straight away if you’re trying to get pregnant or become pregnant while taking it. </li>
        <li>Sertraline can cause withdrawal symptoms so don’t stop taking it without talking to your doctor. </li>
        <li>You can drink alcohol while taking sertraline but it might make you feel sleepy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>Take sertraline once a day. You can choose to take it at any time, as long as you stick to the same time every day. You can take sertraline with or without food. </p>
      <p>For depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, the usual dose of sertraline in adults is 50mg daily. For panic attacks, the usual starting dose of sertraline in adults is 25mg daily for the first week, then 50mg daily after that.</p>

          <p>Sertraline can be used by children aged 6-17 years old, but only for obsessive compulsive disorder. </p>
          <p>The usual starting dose in children aged 6-12 years is 25mg daily but your child’s doctor might increase this to 50mg daily after one week, if needed. The usual starting dose in children aged 13-17 years is 50mg daily. </p>

          <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
          <p>The usual dose of sertraline is 50mg daily in adults. However, it might be started at a lower dose and may be increased gradually to a maximum dose of 200mg daily. </p>
          <p>If you have liver problems your doctor might give you a lower dose, or advise you to take sertraline less often. </p>
          <p>The usual dose of sertraline in children aged 6-12 is 25mg daily, but this may be increased to 50mg daily after one week. The usual dose of sertraline in children aged 13-17 is 50mg daily. Children of any age might have their dose increased up to 200mg daily, if needed.</p>

          <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
          <p>If you forget to take a dose, don’t worry. Take your next dose the next day at the usual time. </p>

          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>Ask your doctor for advice straight away as overdose can lead to potentially serious symptoms such as:</p>
          <ul>

          <h3>Common side effects</h3>
          <p>Like all medicines, sertraline can cause side effects in some people but many people have no side effects or only minor ones. </p>
          <p>These very common side effects affect more than one in 10 people. Keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother you or don't go away:</p>

          <li>changes in your periods such as heavy bleeding, spotting, or bleeding between periods</li>
          <li>painful erections that last longer than four hours - this may happen even when you are not having sex</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Or, if you get any signs of abnormal bleeding including:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>bleeding from the gut: warning signs include vomiting blood or dark vomit; coughing up blood; blood in your urine; black or red poo</li>

          <h3>Serious allergic reaction</h3>
          <p><span class="alertbanner">It’s rare to have an allergic reaction to sertraline but if this happens to you, stop taking the medicine and contact a doctor straight away.</span></p>

          <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
          <p>Some of the common side effects of sertraline will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>What to do about nausea or indigestion</strong>: take sertraline with food and plenty of water.</li>
          <li><strong>What to do about feeling sleepy</strong>: avoid driving or using tools or machinery until the sleepiness wears off. Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink.</li>
          <li><strong>What to do if you’re unable to sleep</strong>: take sertraline first thing in the morning</li>
          <li><strong>What to do if you have a dry mouth</strong>: chew sugar-free gum or sugar-free sweets</li>
          <li><strong>What to do if you feel anxious</strong>: some people who take sertraline for panic attacks find their anxiety worsens during the first few weeks of treatment. This usually wears off after a few weeks but speak to your doctor if it bothers you - a lower dose may help reduce your symptoms. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can lessen the chance of having a side effect if you take sertraline in the evening so that you're asleep when the level of medicine in your body is highest. </p>
          <p>If you have diabetes sertraline can upset its control. Monitor your blood glucose more often for the first few weeks of treatment with sertraline and adjust your diabetes treatment if necessary.</p>
          <p>If you have a side effect from any medicine, including sertraline, you can report it using the Yellow Card Scheme.</p>

            <p>You may see an improvement in your symptoms after a week or two although it usually takes between 4 and 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits.

            <p>Don't stop taking sertraline after a week or two just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.</p>

            <p>Once your condition is under control it is likely that you will continue to take sertraline for several more months to prevent the symptoms returning.</p>
            <p>You will need to discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of continuing to take sertraline in the long term. The decision will depend on the type and severity of your initial symptoms, whether it's a one-off or recurring problem, how well sertraline works for you, and whether you've had any serious side effects.</p>

            <p>Sertraline is mainly used to treat depression, panic attacks, social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is also occasionally used to treat generalised anxiety disorder. </p>
            <p>Sertraline is sometimes prescribed to treat depression in teenage children aged 12-17 years old.</p>

            <p>Don't stop taking sertraline unless your doctor tells you to.</p>
            <p>If you stop taking sertraline suddenly you may get unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. These include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>dizziness</li>
            <li>feeling sick</li>
            <li>numbness or tingling in the hands or feet</li>
            <li>feeling anxious</li>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>shaking </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Withdrawal symptoms are usually harmless and over within a few days but it's possible to prevent them by reducing the dose gradually when you stop taking this medicine.</p>

          <div id="more-6" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Antidepressants, including sertraline, are just one of several approaches to treating depression. Other potential treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)</li>
            <li>exercise programmes</li>
            <li>help to get a good night's sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on how long you have had depression, your symptoms, whether you have had any previous bouts of depression, whether previous treatment has worked, how likely you are to stick with your treatment, the potential side effects and your preferences and priorities.</p>
