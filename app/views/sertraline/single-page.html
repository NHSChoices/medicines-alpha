      <p>Sertraline is a type of antidepressant known as an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).</p>
      <p>It is often used to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx">depression</a>, and also sometimes <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Panic-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx">panic attacks,</a> <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Obsessive-compulsive-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Post-traumatic-stress-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. </p>
      <p>Sertraline helps many people recover from depression, and it has fewer unwanted effects than older antidepressants. </p>
      <p>Sertraline comes as tablets which are available only on prescription.</p>
      <p>It can be taken by children aged six or over.</p>
      <p>It is also called Lustral.</p>

      <h2 id="key-facts" class="content__h2 noborder">Key facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It usually takes four to six weeks for sertraline to work. </li>
        <li>Side effects such as feeling sick, headache and trouble sleeping are common. They are usually mild and go away after a couple of weeks.</li>
        <li>Sertraline can affect an unborn baby. Tell your doctor straight away if you’re trying to get pregnant or become pregnant while taking it. </li>
        <li>Sertraline can cause withdrawal symptoms so don’t stop taking it without talking to your doctor. </li>
        <li>You can drink alcohol while taking sertraline but it might make you feel sleepy.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="how-when">How and when to take</h2>
      <p>Take sertraline once a day.</p>
      <p>The usual dose of sertraline is 50mg a day. The dose may be lower for children.</p>
      <p>You can choose to take sertraline at any time, as long as you stick to the same time every day. If you have trouble sleeping, it's best to take it in the morning.</p>
      <p>Sertraline doesn't upset the stomach so you can take it with or without food.</p>

          <h3>Will my dose go up or down?</h3>
          <p>The usual dose of sertraline is 50mg a day in adults. However, it might be started at a lower dose and may be increased gradually to a maximum dose of 200mg a day. </p>
          <p>If you have liver problems your doctor might give you a lower dose, or advise you to take sertraline less often. </p>
          <p>The usual dose of sertraline in children aged 6 to 12 is 25mg a day, but this may be increased to 50mg a day after one week.</p>
          <p>The usual dose of sertraline in children aged 13 to 17 is 50mg a day. Children of any age might have their dose increased up to 200mg a day, if needed.</p>
          <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
          <p>If you forget to take a dose, don’t worry. Take your next dose the next day at the usual time. Never take two doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
          <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
          <p>Ask your doctor for advice straight away as overdose can lead to potentially serious symptoms such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>vomiting</li>
            <li>tremor</li>
            <li>feeling sleepy</li>

          <h3>Common side effects</h3>
          <p>Like all medicines, sertraline can cause side effects in some people but many people have no side effects or only minor ones. </p>
          <p>These very common side effects affect more than one in 10 people. Keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother you or don't go away:</p>

          <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
          <p>It happens rarely (in fewer than one in 1,000 people), but some people may have serious side effects when taking sertraline. </p>
          <p>Tell a doctor straight away if you develop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>low sodium levels - warning signs include headache, trouble focusing, memory problems, not thinking clearly, weakness, seizures, or losing your balance</li>

            <li>yellow skin or eyes</li>
            <li>putting on or losing weight without trying to</li>
            <li>changes in your periods such as heavy bleeding, spotting, or bleeding between periods</li>
            <li>painful erections that last longer than four hours - this may happen even when you are not having sex</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Or, if you get any signs of abnormal bleeding including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>bleeding from the gut: warning signs include vomiting blood or dark vomit; coughing up blood; blood in your urine; black or red poo</li>
            <li>bleeding from the gums or bruises that appear without a reason or that get bigger</li>
            <li>any bleeding that is very bad or that you cannot stop</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Serious allergic reaction</h3>
          <p><span class="alertbanner">It’s rare to have an allergic reaction to sertraline but if this happens to you, stop taking the medicine and contact a doctor straight away.</span></p>
          <p>The warning signs of a serious allergic reaction are:</p>
          <ul>

          <h3>Coping with side effects</h3>
          <p>Some of the common side effects of sertraline will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
          <h4>What to do about feeling sleepy</h4>
          <p>Cut down the amount of alcohol you drink.</p>
          <h4>What to do about feeling sick</h4>
          <p>Try taking sertraline with or after food to see if that eases feelings of sickness. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food while you're taking this medicine.</p>
          <h4>What to do if you’re unable to sleep</h4>
          <p>Take sertraline first thing in the morning.</p>
          <h4>What to do if you have a dry mouth</h4>
          <p>Chew sugar-free gum or sugar-free sweets.</p>
          <h4>What to do if you feel anxious</h4>
          <p>Some people who take sertraline for panic attacks find their anxiety gets worse during the first few weeks of treatment. This usually wears off after a few weeks but speak to your doctor if it bothers you - a lower dose may help reduce your symptoms. </p>
          <p>You can lessen the chance of having a side effect if you take sertraline in the evening so that you're asleep when the level of medicine in your body is highest. </p>

      <h2 class="content__h2 content__h2--separator" id="not-be-able">Who can take Sertraline</h2>
      <p>Sertraline can be taken by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>children aged 6 to 17 but only for obsessive compulsive disorder</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check with your doctor before starting to take sertraline if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have an allergy to sertraline or any of its ingredients</li>
        <li>have a heart problem as sertraline can speed up or change your heartbeat</li>
        <li>have ever taken any other medicines for depression. Some rarely used antidepressants can interfere with sertraline to cause very high blood pressure even when they have been stopped for a few weeks</li>
        <li>are trying to become pregnant, are already pregnant or are breastfeeding. Sertraline is not recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding</li>
        <li>have an eye condition called glaucoma because sertraline can increase the pressure in your eye</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have diabetes, sertraline can make it more difficult to keep your blood sugar stable. Monitor your blood sugar more often for the first few weeks of treatment with sertraline and adjust your diabetes treatment if necessary.</p>

          <h3>Taking sertraline in pregnancy</h3>

          <p><span class="alertbanner">Tell your doctor if you’re trying to get pregnant or become pregnant while taking sertraline.</span></p>
          <h3>Taking sertraline while breastfeeding</h3>

          </summary>
          <div id="more-1" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Sertraline is one of a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These medicines are thought to work by increasing the levels of a mood-enhancing chemical called serotonin in the brain.</p>

          <div id="more-8" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Antidepressants like sertraline help to jump start your mood so you feel better. You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you’re less anxious. You will hopefully take in your stride little things that used to worry you.</p>
            <p>Sertraline won’t change your personality or make you feel euphorically happy. It will simply help you feel like yourself again.</p>
            <p>Don’t expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.</p>

          <div id="more-2" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>You may see an improvement in your symptoms after a week or two although it usually takes between four and six weeks before you feel the full benefits.That’s because it takes around a week for sertraline levels to build up in your body, and then a few weeks longer for your body to adapt and get used to it.</p>
            <p>Don't stop taking sertraline after a week or two just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least six weeks to work.</p>

            <p>Once your illness is under control it is likely that you will continue to take sertraline for several more months to prevent the symptoms returning.</p>
            <p>You will need to discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of continuing to take sertraline for longer than a few months. The decision will depend on the type and severity of your initial symptoms, whether it's a one-off or recurring problem, how well sertraline works for you, and whether you've had any serious side effects.</p>

            <p>Sertraline isn't any better or worse than other antidepressants. Sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than another. If you aren’t feeling any better after six weeks, talk to your doctor.</p>

            <p>Antidepressants, including sertraline, are just one of several approaches to treating depression. Other potential treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)</li>
              <li>exercise programmes</li>
              <li>help to get a good night's sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on how long you have had depression, your symptoms, whether you have had any previous bouts of depression, whether previous treatment has worked, how likely you are to stick with your treatment, the potential side effects and your preferences and priorities.</p>
